PERICLES 


Caesar once, seeing some wealthy strangers at Rome, carrying up and 
down with them in their arms and bosoms young puppy-dogs and monkeys, 
embracing and making much of them, took occasion not unnaturally to 
ask whether the women in their country were not used to bear children 
by that prince-like reprimand gravely reflecting upon persons who spend 
and lavish upon brute beasts that affection and kindness which nature has 
implanted in us to be bestowed on those of our own kind. With like reason 
may we blame those who misuse that love of inquiry and observation which 
nature has implanted in our souls, by expending it on objects unworthy 
of the attention either of their eyes or their ears, while they disregard such 
as are excellent in themselves, and would do them good 

The mere outward sense, bemg passive in responding to the impression 
af the objects that come m its way and strike upon it, perhaps cannot help 
entertainmg and taking notice of everything that addresses it, be it what 
it will, useful or unuseful, but, in the exercise of his mental perception, 
every man, if he chooses, has a natural power to turn himself upon all 
occasions, and to change and shift with the greatest ease to what he shall 
himself judge desirable So that it becomes a man’s duty to pursue and 
make after the best and choicest of everything, that he may not only 
employ his contemplation, but may also be improved by it For as that 
colour IS more suitable to the eye whose freshness and pleasantness stimu- 
lates and strengthens the sight, so a man ought to apply his intellectual 
perception to such objects as, with the sense of delight, are apt to call it 
forth, and allure it to its own proper good and advantage. 

Such objects we find in the acts of virtue, which also pioduce in the 
mmds of mere readers about them an emulation and eagerness that may 
lead them on to imitation. In other things there does not immediately 
follow upon the admiration and hkmg of the'thmg done any strong desire 
©I doing the like. Nay, many times, on the very contrary, when we are 
oleased with the work, we slight and set little by the workman or artist 
nimself, as, for instance, in perfumes and purple dyes we are taken with 



PERICLES 183 

the things themselves well enough, but do not think dyers and perfumers 
otherwise than low and sordid people It was not said amiss by Antisthenes, 
when people told him that one Ismenias was an excellent piper “It may be 
so,” said he, “but he is but a wretched human bemg, otherwise he would 
not have been an excellent piper.” And Kmg Philip, to the same purpose, 
told his son Alexander, who once at a merry-meeting played a piece of 
music charmingly and skilfully, “Are you not ashamed, son, to play so 
well^” For it is enough for a king or prince to find leisure sometimes to 
hear others sing, and he does the muses quite honour enough when he 
pleases to be but present, while others engage in such exercises and trials 
of skill. 

He who busies himself in mean occupations produces, in the very pains 
he takes about things of little or no use, an evidence against himself of his 
negligence and indisposition to what is really good Nor did any generous 
and ingenuous young man, at the sight of the statue of Jupiter at Pisa, 
ever desire to be a Phidias, or on seeing that of Juno at Argos, long to be 
a Polycletus, or feel induced by his pleasure m their poems to wish to 
be an Anacreon or Philetas or Archilochus For it does not necessarily 
follow, that, if a piece of work please for its gracefulness, therefore he that 
wrought it deserves our admiration. Whence it is that neither do such 
things really profit or advantage the beholders, upon the sight of which 
no zeal arises for the imitation of them, nor any impulse or inclmation, 
which may prompt any desire or endeavour of doing the like. But virtue, 
by the bare statement of its actions, can so affect men’s minds as to create 
at once both admiration of the things done and desire to imitate the doers 
of them. The goods of fortune we would possess and would enjoy, those of 
virtue we long to practise and exercise we are content to receive the for- 
mer from others, the latter we wish others to experience from us. Moral 
good is a practical stimulus, it is no sooner seen, than it inspires an im- 
pulse to practice, and influences the mind and character not by a mere 
imitation which we look at, but by the statement of the fact creates a 
moral purpose which we form 

And so we have thought fit to spend our time and pams in writing of the 
lives of famous persons, and have composed this tenth book upon that 
subject, contammg the life of Pericles, and that of Fabius Maximus, who 
carried on the war agamst Hannibal, men alike, as m their other virtues 
and good parts, so especially in their mind and upright temper and de- 
meanour, and in that capacity to bear the cross-grained humours of their 
fellow-citizens and colleagues m office, which made them both most useful 
and serviceable to the interests of their countries Whether we take a right 
aim at our intended purpose, it is left to the reader to judge by what he 
shall here find 

Pericles was of the tribe Acamantis, and the township Cholargus, of the 
noblest birth both on his father’s and mother’s side. Xanthippus, his father, 
who defeated the King of Persia’s generals m the battle of Mycale, took 
to wife Aganste, the grandchild of Clisthenes, who drove out the sons of 
Pisistratus, and nobly put an end to their tyrannical usurpation, and, 



184 PLUTARCH'S LIVES 

^noreover, made a body of laws, and settled a model of government ad- 
mirably tempered and suited for the harmony and safety of the people 
His mother, bemg near her time, fancied in a dream that she was brought 
to bed of a lion, and a few days after was delivered of Pericles, in other 
respects perfectly foimed, only his head was somewhat longish and out of 
proportion For which -Cdson almost all the images and statues that were 
made of him have the h^ad covered with a helmet, the workmen apparently 
bemg Willing not to expose him The poets of Athens called him Schino^ 
cephalos, or squill-head, from schmos, a squill, or sea-omon One of the 
comic poets, Cratmus, in the Chirons, tells us that — 

‘‘Old Chronos once took queen Sedition to wife 
Which two brought to life 
That tyrant far-famed. 

Whom the gods the supreme skull-compeller have named, 

and, in the Nemesis, addresses him — 

“Come, Jove, thou head of Gods 

And a second, Teleclides, says, that now, in embarrassment with political 
difficulties, he sits in the city — 

“Faintmg underneath the load 
Of Ins own head and now abroad 
From his huge gallery of a pate 
Sends forth trouble to the state.” 

And a third, Eupolis, in the comedy called the Demi, in a series of ques- 
tions about each of the demagogues, whom he makes in the play to come 
up from hell, upon Pericles being named last, exclaims — 

“And here by way of summary, now weVe done, 

Behold, in brief, the heads of all in one.” 

The master that taught him music, most authors are agreed, was 
Damon (whose name, they say, ought to be pronounced with the first 
syllable short). Though Aristotle tells us that he was thoroughly practised 
m all accomplishments of this kind by Pythoclides Damon, it is not un- 
likely, being a sophist, out of pohcy sheltered himself under the profession 
of music to conceal from people m general his skill in other things, and 
tinder this pretence attended Perides, the young athlete of politics, so to 
say, as his trammg-master in these exercises Damon’s lyre, however, did 
not prove altogether a successful blmd; he was banished the country by 
ostracism for ten years, as a dangerous intermeddler and a favourer of 
arbitrary power, and, by this means, gave the stage occasion to play upon 
him. As, for instance, Plato, the comic poet, introduces a character who 
questions him— 



18S 


PERICLES 
^Tell me, if you please, 

Since you’re the Chiron who taught Pericles ” 

Pericles, also, was a hearer of Zeno, the Eleatic, who treated of natural 
philosophy in the same manner as Parmenides did, but had also perfected 
himself in an art of his own for refuting and silencing opponents in argu- 
ment, as Timon of Phlius describes it — 

^'Also the two-edged tongue of mighty Zeno, who^ 

Say what one would, could argue it untrue ” 

But he that saw most of Pericles, and furnished him most especially with 
a weight and grandeur of sense, superior to all arts of popularity, and in 
general gave him his elevation and sublimity of purpose and of character, 
was Anaxagoras of Clazomense, whom the men of those times called by 
the name of Nous, that is, mind, or intelligence, whether in admiration of 
the great and extraordinary gift he had displayed for the science of nature, 
or because that he was the first of the philosophers who did not refer the 
first ordering of the world to fortune or chance, nor to necessity or com- 
pulsion, but to a pure, unadulterated intelligence, which m all other existing 
mixed and compound things acts as a prmaple of discrimmation, and of 
combination of like with like. 

For this man, Pericles entertained an extraordinary esteem and admira- 
tion, and filling himself with this lofty and, as they call it, up-m-the-ait 
sort of thought, derived hence not merely, as was natural, elevation of 
purpose and digmty of language, raised far above the base and dishonest 
buffooneries of mob eloquence, but, besides this, a composure of counte- 
nance, and a serenity and calmness in all his movements, which no occur- 
rence whilst he was speaking could disturb, a sustained and even tone of 
voice, and various other advantages of ? similar kmd, which produced the 
greatest effect on his hearers Once, after oemg reviled and ill-spoken of all 
day long in his own hearing by some vile and abandoned fellow in the open 
market-place, where he was engaged in the despatch of some urgent affair 
he continued his busmess in perfect silence, and in the evening returned 
home composedly, the man still dogging him at the heels, and pelting him 
all the way with abuse and foul language, and stepping into his house, it 
being by this time dark, he ordered one of his servants to take a light, and 
to go along with the man and see him safe home Ion, it is true, the dramatic 
poet, says that Pericles’s manner in company was somewhat over-assuming 
and pompous, and that mto his high-bearmg there entered a good deal of 
slightmgness and scorn of others , he reserves his commendation for Cimon’s 
ease and pliancy and natural grace m society Ion, however, who must needs 
make virtue, like a show of tragedies, include some comic scenes, we shall 
not altogether rely upon; Zeno used to bid those who called Pericles’s 
gravity the affectation of a charlatan, to go and affect the like themselves, 
inasmuch as this mere counterfeiting might in time insensibly instil into 
them a 'f eal love and knowledge of those noble qualitieSo 



186 Plutarch’s LIVES 

Nor were these the only advantages which Pericles derived from Anaxa 
goras’s acquaintance, he seems also to have become, by his instructions, 
superior to that superstition with which an ignorant wonder at appearances, 
for example, m the heavens, possesses the mmds of people unacquainted 
with their causes, eager for the supernatural, and exatable through 
an inexperience wMch the knowledge of natural causes removes, replaang 
wild and timid superstition by the good hope and assurance of an intelligent 
piety. 

There is a story, that once Pericles had brought to him from a country 
farm of his a ram’s head with one horn, and that Lampon, the diviner, 
upon seemg the horn grow strong and sohd out of the midst of the fore- 
head, gave it as his judgment, that, there bemg at that tune two potent 
factions, parties, or mterests in the aty, the one of Thucydides and the 
other of Pericles, the government would come about to that one of them 
m whose ground or estate this token or indication of fate had shown itself. 
But that Anaxagoras, cleaving the skull m sunder, showed to the by- 
standers that the brain had not filled up its natural place, but being oblong, 
like an egg, had collected from all parts of the vessel which contained it in 
a pomt to that place from whence the root of the horn took its rise And 
that, for that time, Anaxagoras was much admired for his explanation by 
those that were present, and Lampon no less a httle while after, when Thu- 
cydides was overpowered, and the whole affairs of the state and government 
came mto the hands of Pencles. 

And yet, m my opinion, it is no absurdity to say that they were both 
in the right, both natural philosopher and divmer, one justly detecting 
the cause of this event, by which it was produced, the other the end for 
which It was designed For it was the busmess of the one to find out and 
give an account of what it was made, and m what manner and by what 
means it grew as it did, and of the other to foretell to what end and pur- 
pose it was so made, and what it might mean or portend. Those who say 
that to find out the cause of a prodigy is in effect to destroy its supposed 
signification as such, do not take notice, that, at the same time, together 
with divme prodigies, they also do away with signs and signals of human 
9 ^ and concert, as, for mstance, the dashmgs of quoits, fire-beacons, and 
the shadows of sun-dids, every one of which has its cause, and by that 
cause and contrivance is a sign of somethmg else But these are subjects, 
perhaps, that would better befit another place 

Per^ffi, while yet but a young man, stood m considerable apprehen- 
sion of the people, as he was thought m face and figure to be very like 
the tyrant Pisistratus, and those of great age remarked upon the sweetness 
of voice, and his volubility and rapidity m speakmg, and were struck 
with amazement at the resemblance Reflecting, too, that he had a con- 
siderable estate, and was descended of a noble family, and had friends of 
great influence, he was fearful all this might bring him to be banished as 
a dangerous person, and for this reason meddled not at all with state 
affairs, ^t in military service showed himself of a brave and intrepid 
nature. But when Aristides was now dead, and Themistocles driven out, 



PERICLES 187 

and Cimon was for the most part kept abroad by the expeditions he made 
m parts out of Greece, Pericles, seeing things in this posture, now ad- 
vanced and took his side, not with the rich and few, but with the many 
and poor, contrary to his natural bent, which was far from democratical, 
but, most likely fearing he might fall under suspicion of aiming at arbi- 
trary power, and seeing Cimon on the side of the aristocracy, and much 
beloved by the better and more distinguished people, he joined the party 
of the people, with a view at once both to secure himself and procure 
means against Cimon 

He immediately entered, also, on quite a new course of life and manage 
ment of his time For he was never seen to walk in any street but that which 
led to the market-place and council-hall, and he avoided invitations of 
friends to supper, and all friendly visiting and intercourse whatever, in all 
the time he had to do with the public, which was not a little, he was never 
known to have gone to any of his friends to a supper, except that once 
when his near kinsman Euryptolemus married, he remained present till the 
ceremony of the drink-offering, and then immediately rose from table and 
went his way For these friendly meetings are very quick to defeat any 
assumed superiority, and m intimate familiarity an exterior of gravity is 
hard to maintain Real excellence, indeed, is most recognised when most 
openly looked into, and in really good men, nothmg which meets the 
eves of external observers so truly deserves their admiration, as their 
daily common life does that of their nearer friends. Pericles, however, 
to avoid any feehng of commonness, or any satiety on the part of the 
people, presented himself at intervals only, not speaking to every business, 
nor at all times coming into the assembly, but, as Critolaus says, reserv- 
ing himself, like the Salammian galley, for great occasions, while matters of 
lesser importance were despatched by friends or other speakers under his 
direction And of this number we are told Ephialtes made one, who broke 
the power of the council of Areopagus, giving the people, according to 
Plato’s expression, so copious and so strong a draught of liberty, that grow- 
ing wild and unruly, like an unmanageable horse, it, as the comic poets 
say — 

« ^got beond aU keeping in, 

Champing at Euboea, and among the islands leaping in.” 

The style of speaking most consonant to his form of life and the dignity 
of his views he found, so to say, in the tones of that instrument with which 
Anaxagoras had furnished him, of his teaching he contmually availed him* 
self, and deepened the colours of rhetoric with the dye of natural science 
For having, in addition to his great natural gemus, attained, by the study 
of nature, to use the words of the divine Plato, this height of intelligence, 
and this universal consummatmg power, and drawing hence whatever 
might be of advantage to him in the art of speaking, he showed himself far 
superior to all others Upon which account, they say, he had his nick- 
uame given him, though some are of opimon he was named the Olympian 



i88 PLUTARCH'S LIVES 

irom the public buildings with which he adorned the city, and others 
again, from his great power in public affairs, whether of war or peace Nor 
is it unlikely that the confluence of many attributes may have conferred 
it on him However, the comedies represented at the time, which, both in 
good earnest and in merriment, let fly many hard words at him, plainly 
show that he got that appellation especially from his speaking, they speak 
of his ^^thundermg and lightning^’ when he harangued the people, and of 
his wielding a dreadful thunderbolt in his tongue. 

A saying also of Thucydides, the son of Melesias, stands on record, 
spoken by him by way of pleasantry upon Pericles’s dexterity Thucydides 
was one of the noble and distinguished citizens, and had been his greatest 
opponent; and, when Archidamus, the King of the Lacedaemonians, asked 
him whether he or Pericles were the better wrestler, he made this an- 
swer* ^‘When I,” said he, ^^have thrown him and given him a fair fall, by 
persisting that he had no fall, he gets the better of me, and makes the 
bystanders, in spite of their own eyes, believe him ” The truth, however, 
is, that Pericles himself was very careful what and how he was to speak, 
insomuch that, whenever he went up to the hustings, he prayed the gods 
that no one word might unawares slip from him unsuitable to the matter 
and the occasion 

He has left nothing in writing behind him, except some decrees, and 
there are but very few of his saymgs recorded, one, for example, is, that 
he said -$gma must, like a gathering in a man’s eye, be removed from 
Piraeus; and another, that he said he saw already war moving on its way 
towards them out of Peloponnesus Again, when on a time Sophocles, who 
was his fellow-commissioner m the generalship, was going on board with 
him, and praised the beauty of a youth they met with in the way to the 
ship, ‘^Sophocles,” said he, ‘‘a general ought not only to have clean hands 
but also clean eyes.” And Stesimbrotus tells us that, in his encomium on 
those who fell m battle at Samos, he said they were become immortal, 
as the gods were. “For,” said he, “we do not see them themselves, but 
only by the honours we pay them, and by the benefits they do us, 
attribute to them immortality; and the like attributes belong also to 
those that die m the service of their country.” 

Since Thucydides describes the rule of Pericles as an aristocratical 
government, that went by the name of a democracy, but was, indeed, 
the supremacy of a single great man, while many others say, on the 
contrary, that by him the common people were first encouraged and led 
on to such evils as appropriations of subject territory, allowances for 
attending theatres, payments for performing public duties, and by these 
bad habits were, under the influence of his public measures, changed 
from a sober, thrifty people, that maintained themselves by their own 
labours, to lovers of expense, intemperance, and licence, let us examine 
the cause of this change by the actual matters of fact 

At the first, as has been said, when he set himself against Cimon’s great 
authonty, he did caress the people. Finding himself come shoit of his 
pompetitor in wealth and money, by which advantages the other was 



PERICLES 189 

enabled to take care of the poor, inviting every day some one oi other of 
the citizens that was in want to supper, and bestowmg clothes on the agea 
people, and breaking down the hedges and enclosures of his grounds, that 
all that would might freely gather what fruit they pleased, Pericles, thus 
outdone in popular arts, by the advice of one Damonides of CEa, as 
Aristotle states, turned to the distribution of the pubhc moneys, and in a 
short time having bought the people over, what with moneys allowed for 
shows and for service on juries, and what with other forms of pay and 
largess, he made use of them against the council of Areopagus of which 
he himself was no member, as having never been appointed by lot either 
chief archon, or lawgiver, or king, or captain. For from of old these offices 
were conferred on persons by lot, and they who had acquitted themselves 
duly in the discharge of them were advanced to the court of Areopagus. 
And so Pericles, having secured his power m interest with the populace, 
directed the exertions of his party against this council with such success, 
that most of these causes and matters which had been used to be tried 
there were, by the agency of Ephialtes, removed from its cognisance, 
Cimcrn, also, was banished by ostracism as a favourer of the Lacedeemon- 
lans and a hater of the people, though m wealth and noble birth he was 
among the fifst, and had won several most glorious victories over the 
barbarians, and had filled the city with money and spoils of war, as is 
recorded in the history of his life. So vast an authority had Pericles 
obtained among the people. ^ i 

The ostracism was limited by law to ten years, but the Lacedaemonians/ 
in the meantime, entering with a great army mto the territory of Tanagra, 
and the Athenians going out against them, Cimon, coming from his banish-i 
ment before his time was out, put himself m arms and array with those 
of his fellow-citizens that were of his own tribe, and desired by his deeds 
to wipe off the suspicion of his favouring the Lacedaemonians, by ventur- 
ing his own person along with his countr3niien. But Pericles’s friends, 
gathering in a body, forced him to retire as a banished man. For which 
cause also Pericles seems to have exerted himself more in that than in any 
battle, and to have been conspicuous above all for his exposure of h^mselj 
to danger All Cimon’s friends, also, to a man, fell together side by side, 
whom Pericles had accused with him of taking part with the Lacedsemon- 
&ns Defeated in this battle on their own frontiers, and expecting a new 
and perilous attack with return of spring, the Athenians now felt regret 
and sorrow for the loss of Cimon, and repentance for their expulsion of 
hun Pericles, being sensible of their feelings, did not hesitate or delay 
to gratify it, and himself made the motion for recalling him home. He, 
upon his return, concluded a peace betwixt the two cities, for the Lace- 
daemonians entertained as kindly feelings towards him as they did the 
reverse towards Pericles and the other popular leaders 
Yet some there are who say that Pericles did not propose the order foi 
Cimon’s return till some private articles of agreement had been made 
between them, and this by means of Elpimce, Cimon’s sister, that Cimon, 
namely, should go out to sea with a fleet of two hundred ships, and 



190 PLUTARCH^S LIVES 

tommander-m-chief abroad, with a design to reduce the King of Persia’s 
territories, and that Pericles should have the power at home 

This Elpmice, it was thought, had before this time procured some 
favour for her brother Cimon at Pericles's hands, and induced him to be 
more remiss and gentle in urging the charge when Cimon was tried for his 
life, for Pericles was one of the committee appointed by the commons to 
plead against him And when Elpmice came and besought him m her 
brother's behalf, he answered, with a smile, ''O Elpmice, you are too old 
a woman to undertake such busmess as this " But, when he appeared 
to impeach him, he stood up but once to speak, merely to acquit himself 
of his commission, and went out of court, having done Cimon the least 
prejudice of any of his accusers 

How, then, can one believe Idomeneus, who charges Pericles as if he 
had by treachery procured the murder of Ephialtes, the popular statesman, 
one who was his friend, and of his own party m all his political course, 
out of jealousy, forsooth, and envy of his great reputation? This his- 
torian, it seems, having raked up these stones, I know not whence, has 
befouled with them a man who, perchance, was not altogether free from 
fault or blame, but yet had a noble spirit, and a soul that was bent on 
honour, and where such qualities are, there can no such cruel and brutal 
passion find harbour or gam admittance As to Ephialtes, the truth of the 
story, as Aristotle has told it, is this that having made himself formid- 
able to the oligarchical party, by being an uncompromising asserter of 
the people's rights in caUmg to account and prosecuting those who any 
way wronged them, his enemies, lying m wait for him, by the means of 
Aristodicus the Tanagraean, privately despatched him. 

Cimon, while he was admiral, ended his days m the Isle of C3rprus. And 
the aiistocratical party, seeing that Pericles was already before this grown 
to be the greatest and foremost man of all the city, but nevertheless wish- 
mg there should be somebody set up against him, to blunt and turn the 
edge of his power, that it nught not altogether prove a monarchy, put 
forwaid Thucydides of Alopece, a discreet person, and a near kinsman 
of Cnnon's, to conduct the opposition against him; who, indeed, though 
less skilled m warlike affairs than Cimon was, yet was better versed m 
speaking and political business and keeping close guard m the city, andl, 
engaging with Pericles on the hustmgs, in a short time brought the gov- 
ernment to an equality of parties. For he would not suffer those who 
were called the honest and good (persons of worth and distinction) to be 
scattered up and down and mix themselves and be lost among the 
populace, as formerly, dimimshmg and obscuring their superiority amongst 
the masses, but taking them apart by themselves and uniting them in one 
body, by their combined weight he was able, as it were upon the balance, 
to make a counterpoise to the other party. 

For, mdeed, there was from the beginning a sort of concealed split, or 
seam, as it might be in a piece of iron, marking the different popular and 
aristocratical tendencies, but the open rivalry and contention of these two 
opponents made the gash deep, and severed the city into the two parties 



PERICLES 191 

of the people and the few. And so Pericles, at that time, more than at any 
other, let loose the reins to the people, and made his policy subservient 
to their pleasure, contriving continually to have some great public show 
or solemnity, some banquet, or some procession or other in the town to 
please them, coaxing his countrymen like children with such delights and 
pleasures as ware not, however, unedifymg Besides that every year he sent 
out threescore galleys, on board of which there were numbers of the 
citizens, who were in pay eight months, learning at the same time and 
practising the art of seamanship. 

He sent, moreover, a thousand of them into the Chersonese as planters, 
to share the land among them by lot, and five hundred more mto the 
isle of Naxos, and half that number to Andros, a thousand into Thrace to 
dwell among the Bisaltse, and others into It^y, when the city Sybaris, 
which now was called Thurii, was to be repeopled And this he did to 
ease and discharge the city of an idle, and, by reason of their idleness, 
a busy meddling crowd of people, and at the same time to meet the 
necessities and restore the fortunes of the poor townsmen, and to intimi- 
date, also, and check their allies from attempting any change, by posting 
such garrisons, as it were, in the midst of them. 

That which gave most pleasure and ornament to the city of Athens, 
and the greatest admiration and even astonishment to all strangers, and 
that which now is Greece’s only evidence that the power she boast'i of 
and her ancient wealth are no romance or idle story, was his construction 
of the public and sacred buildings Yet this was that of all his actions in 
the government which his enemies most looked askance upon and cavilled 
at in the popular assemblies, crying out how that the commonwealth of 
Athens had lost its reputation and was ill-spoken of abroad for removing 
the common treasure of the Greeks from the Isle of Delos into their own 
custody, and how that their fairest excuse for so doing, namely, that they 
took it away for fear the barbarians should seize it, and on purpose to 
secure it in a safe place, this Pericles had made unavailable, and hoW 
that “Greece cannot but resent it as an insufferable affront, and consider 
herself to be tyrannised over openly, when she sees the treasure, which wa® 
contributed by her upon a necessity for the war, wantonly lavished out b]* 
us upon our city, to gild her all over, and to adorn and set her ^orth, as 
it were some vain woman, hung round with precious stones and figure*' 
and temples, •which cost a -world of money.” 

Pericles, on the other hand, informed the people, that they were in ne 
way obliged to give any account of those moneys to their allies, so long 
as they mamtamed their defence, and kept off the barbarians from at- 
tackmg them, while in the meantime they did not so much as supply one 
horse or man or ship, but only found money for the service; which 
money,” said he, “is not theirs that give it, but theirs that receive it, if

give them eternal honour, and, for the present, while in process, freely 
supply all the inhabitants with plenty. With their variety of workman- 
ship and of occasions for service, which summon all arts and trades and 
require all hands to be employed about them, they do actually put the 
whole city, in a manner, into state-pay, while at the same time she is 
both beautiful and mamtamed by herself. For as those who are of age 
and strength for war are provided for and mamtamed m the armaments 
abroad by their pay out of the public stock, so, it being his desire and 
design that the undisciplined mechanic multitude that stayed at home 
should not go without their share of public salaries, and yet should not 
have them given them for sitting still and doing nothing, to that end he 
thought fit to brmg m among them, with the approbation of the people, 
these vast projects of buildmgs and designs of work, that would be of 
some contmuance before they were finished, and would give emplojnnent 
to numerous arts, so that the part of the people that stayed at home 
might, n*. less than those that were at sea or in garrisons or on expeditions, 
have a fam and just occasion of receivmg the benefit and havmg them 
share of the public moneys 

The materials were stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypresswood, and 
the arts or trades that wrought and fashioned them were smiths and car- 
penters, moulders, founders and braziers, stone-cutters, dyers, goldsmiths, 
ivory-workers, pamters, embioiderers, turners, those again that conveyed 
them to the town for use, merchants and mariners and ship-masters by 
sea, and by lane ■'artwrights, cattle-breeders, waggoners, rope-makers, 
flax-workers, shoe kers and leather-dressers, road-makers, miners. And 
every trade m the same nature, as a captain in an army has his particular 
company of soldiers under him, had its own hired company of journey- 
men and labourers belonging t'> it banded together as in array, to be as it 
trere the instrument and body for the performance of the service. Thus, 
CO say all m a word, the occasions and services of these pubhc works 
distnbuted plenty through every age and condition. 

As then grew the worlm up, no less statdy in size than exquisite in form, 
the workmen striving to outvie the material and the design with the beauty 
of their workmanship, yet the most wonderful thing of all was the rapidity 
of their execution. 

ITndertakmgs, any one of which sm^y might have required, they 
.thought, for their completion, several successions and ages of men, were 
every one of them accomplished in the height and prime of one man’s 
political service. Although they say, too, that Zeuxis once, havmg heard 
Agatharchus the pamter boast of despatching his work with speed and 
ease, replied, “I take a long time.” For ease and ^eed in domg a thing 
do not give the work lasting sohdity or exactness of beauty; the ex- 
penditure of time allowed to a man’s pains beforehand for the production 

a thing is repaid by way of inta:®t with a vital force for the preserva- 
tioa when once produced. For which reason Pericles’s works are especially 
admired, as having been made quickly, to last long For every particular 
pece of his work was immediately, even at that time, for its beauty and 



PERICLES 193 

elegance, antique; and yet in its vigour and freshness looks to this day 
as if it were just executed There is a sort of bloom of newness upon those 
works of his, preserving them from the touch of time, as if they had some 
perennial spirit and undying vitality mingled in the composition of 
them 

Phidias had the oversight of all the works, and was surveyor-general, 
though upon the various portions other great masters and workmen were 
employed For Callicrates and Ictinus built the Parthenon, the chapel at 
Eleusis, where the mysteries were celebrated, was begun by Coroebus, 
who erected the pillars that stand upon the floor or pavement, and joined 
them to the architraves, and after his death Metagenes of Xypete added 
the frieze and the upper line of columns, Xenocles of Cholargus roofed 
or arched the lantern on top of the temple of Castor and Pollux; and the 
long wall, which Socrates says he himself heard Pericles propose to the 
people, was undertaken by Callicrates This work Cratmus ridicules, as 
long in finishing — 

“’Tis long since Pericles, if words would do it, 

Talked up the wall, yet adds not one mite to it,” 

The Odeum, or music-room, which in its interior was full ot seats and 
ranges of pillars, and outside had its roof made to slope and descend from 
one single point at the top, was constructed, we are told, m imitation of the 
King of Persia’s Pavilion, this likewise by Pericles’s order; which Crati- 
nus again, in his comedy called the Thracian Women, made an occasion 
of raillery — 


^*So, we see here, 

Jupiter Long-pate Pericles appear. 

Since ostracism time, he’s laid aside his head, 

And wears the new Odeum m its stead ” 

Pericles, also eager for distinction, then first obtained the decree for a 
contest m musical skill to be held yearly at the Panathensea, and he him- 
self, being chosen judge, arranged the order and method in which the 
competitors should sing and play on the flute and on the harp. And both 
at that time, and at other times also, they sat m this music-room to see 
and hear all such trials of skill. 

The propylaea, or entrances to the Acropolis, were finished in five years’ 
time, Mnesicles being the principal architect A strange accident happened/ 
in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse 
to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection 
One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them 
all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a 
miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When 
Pericles was in distress about this, Minerva appeared to him at night in 
a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a 
short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion 



194 PLUTARCH^S LIVES 

was that he set up a brass statue of Minerva, surnamed Health, in the 
citadel near the altar, which they say was there before But it was Phidias 
who wrought the goddess’s image in gold, and he has his name mscribed on 
the pedestal as the workman of it , and indeed the whole work m a manner 
was imder his charge, and he had, as we have said already, the oversight 
over all the artists and workmen, through Pericles’s friendship for him, 
and this, mdeed, made him much envied, and his patron shamefully 
slandered with stones, as if Phidias were in the habit of receiving, for 
Pericles’s use, freeborn women that came to see the works The comic 
Wnters of the town, when they had got hold of this story, made much of 
It, and bespattered him with all the ribaldry they could mvent, charging 
him falsely with the wife of Menippus, one who was his friend and served 
aslieutenant under him m the wars , and with the birds kept by Pyrilampes, 
an acquaintance of Pericles, who, they pretended, used to give presents of 
peacocks to Pericles’s female friends And how can one wonder at any 
number of strange assertions from men whose whole hves were devoted 
to mockery, and who were ready at any time to sacrifice the reputation 
of their superiors to vulgar envy and spite, as to some evil genius, when 
even Stesimbrotus the Tlu-aaan has dared to lay to the charge of Pericles 
a monstrous and fabulous piece of crimmahty with his son’s wife? So very 
difficult a matter is it to trace and find out the truth of anythmg by his- 
tory, when, on the one hand, those who afterwards write it find long 
periods of time intercepting their view, and, on the other hand, the con- 
temporary records of any actions and lives, partly through envy and ill- 
will, partly through favour and flattery, pervert and distort truth. 

' IS^en the orators, who sided with Thucydides and his party, were at 
one time crjong out, as their custom was, against Pericles, as one who 
squandered away the public money, and made havoc of the state revenues, 
he rose m the open assembly and put the question to the people, whether 
they thought that he had laid out much, and they saymg, “Too much, a 
great deal,” “Then,” said he, “since it is so, let the cost not go to your 
account, but to mme, and let the inscription upon the buildings stand in 
my name ” When they heard him say thus, whether it were out of a 
surprise to see the greatness of his spirit or out of emulation of the glory 
of the works, they cried aloud, biddmg him to spend on, and lay out 
what he thought fit from the pubhc purse, and to spare no cost, till all 
were finished. 

At length, commg to a final contest with Thucydides which of the two 
should ostracise the other out of the country, and having gone through 
this peril, he threw his antagonist out, and broke up the confederacy that 
had been organised agamst him. So that now all schism and division being 
at an end, and the city brought to evenness and imity, he got all Athens 
and all affairs that pertained to the Athenians mto his own hands, their 
tributes, their armies, and their galleys, the islands, the sea, and their wide- 
extended power, pa^y over other Greeks and partly over barbarians, and 
all that empire, which they poss^sed, founded and fortified upon subject 
nations and royal friendships and alli ances 



PERICLES 195 

After this he was no longer the same man he had been before, nor as 
tame and gentle and familiar as formerly with the populace, so as readily 
to yield to their pleasures and to comply with the desires of the multitude, 
as a steersman shifts with the winds Quittmg that loose, remiss, and, in 
some cases, licentious court of the popular will, he turned those soft and 
flowery modulations to the austerity of anstocratical and regal rule, and 
employing this uprightly and undeviatingly for the country’s best interests, 
he was able generally to lead the people along, with their own wills and 
consents, by persuading and showing them what was to be done, and 
sometimes, too, urging and pressing them forward extremely^ against 
their will, he made them, whether they would or no, yield submission to 
what was for their advantage In which, to say the truth, he did but 
like a skilful physician, who, in a complicated and chronic disease, as he 
sees occasion, at one while allows his patient the moderate use of such 
things as please him, at another while gives him keen pains and drug 
to work the cure For there arising and growing up, as was natural, all 
manner of distempered feelings among a people which had so vast a com 
mand and dominion, he alone, as a great master, knowing how to handk 
and deal fitly with each one of them, and, in an especial manner, making 
that use of hopes and fears, as his two chief rudders, with the one to check 
the career of their confidence at any time, with the other to raise them 
up and cheer them when under any discouragement, plainly showed by 
this, that rhetoric, or the art of speaking, is, in Plato’s language, the 
government of the souls of men, and that her chief business is to address 
the affections and passions, which are as it were the strings and keys to 
the soul, and require a skilful and careful touch to be played on as they 
should be The source of this predominance was not barely his power of 
language, but, as Thucydides assures us, the reputation of his life, and 
the confidence felt m his character, his manifest freedom from every kind 
of corruption, and superiority to all considerations of money Notwith- 
standing he had made the city of Athens, which was great of itself, as 
great and rich as can be imagined, and though he were himself in power 
and interest more than equal to many kmgs and absolute rulers, who 
some of them also bequeathed by will their power to their children, he, for 
his part, did not make the patrimony his father left him greater than 
it was by one drachma 

Thucydides, indeed, gives a plain statement of the greatness of his 
power, and the comic poets, in their spiteful manner, more than hint at 
it, styling his companions and friends the new Pisistratidse, and calling 
on him to abjure any intention of usurpation, as one whose eminence was 
too great to be any longer proportionable to and compatible with a demo- 
cracy or popular government And Teleclides says the Athenians had sur- 
rendered up to him — 

*‘The tribute of the cities, and with them, the cities too, to do with them 
as he pleases, and undo. 

To build up, if he likes, stone walls aroimd a town, and agam, if so he 
llk^G- to pull them down 



196 PLUTARCH'S LIVES 

Their treaties and alliances, power, empire, peace, and war, their wealth 
and their success forever more ” 

Nor was all this the luck of some happy occasion, nor was it the mere 
bloom and grace of a policy that flourished for a season, but having for 
forty years together maintained the first place among statesmen such as 
Ephialtes and leocrates and Myronides and Cimon and Tolmides and 
Thucydides were, after the defeat and banishment of Thucydides, for no 
less than fifteen years longer, in the exercise of one continuous umnter- 
mitted command in the office, to which he was annually re-elected, of 
General, he preserved his integrity unspotted, though otherwise he was 
not altogether idle or careless m looking after his pecuniary advantage, 
his paternal estate, which of right belonged to him, he so ordeied that it 
might neither through negligence be wasted or lessened, nor yet, being 
so full of business as he was, cost him any gieat trouble or time with taking 
care of it, and put it into such a way of management as he thought to 
be the most easy for himself^ and the most exact All his yearly products 
and profits he sold together in a lump, and supphed his household needs 
afterwards by buying everythmg that he or his family wanted out of the 
market Upon which account, his children, when they grew to age, were 
not well pleased with his management, and the women that lived with 
him were treated with little cost, and complained of his way of house- 
keeping, where everythmg was ordered and set down from day to day, 
and reduced to the greatest exactness, since there was not there, as is 
usual in a great family and a plentiful estate, anything to spare, or over 
and above, but all that went out or came in, all disbursements and all 
receipts, proceeded as it were by number and measure His manager in 
all this was a single servant, Evangelus by name, a man either naturally 
gifted or instructed by Pericles so as to excel every one in this art of 
domestic economy. 

All this, in truth, was very little in harmony with Anaxagoias’s wisdom , 
if, indeed, it be true that he, by a kind of divine impulse and greatness of 
spirit, voluntarily quitted his house, and left his land to he fallow and 
to be grazed by sheep like a common But the life of a contemplative 
philosopher and that of an active statesman are, I presume, not the same 
thing, for the one merely employs, upon great and good objects of 
thought, an intelligence that requires no aid of instruments nor supply 
of any external materials, whereas the other, who tempers and applies his 
4rtue to human uses, may have occasion for affluence, not as a matter 
of necessity, but as a noble thmg, which was Pericles’s case, who relieved 
numerous poor citizens 

However, there is a story that Anaxagoras himself, while Pericles was 
taken up with public affairs, lay neglected, and that, now being grown old, 
he wrapped himself up with a resolution to die for want of food, which 
being by chance brought to Pericles’s ear, he was horror-struck, and in- 
ttantly ran thither, and used all the arguments and entreaties he could 
to him lamenting not so much Anaxagoras’s condition as his own, should! 



PERICLES 197 

he lose such a counsellor as he had found hina to be, and that, upon 
this, Anaxagoras unfolded his robe, and showing himself, made answer: 
‘Tericles,’’ said he, ^^even those who have occasion for a lamp supply it 
with oil ’’ 

The Lacedaemonians beginning to show themselves troubled at the 
growth of the Athenian power, Pericles, on the other hand, to elevate 
the people’s spirit yet more, and to raise them to the thought of great 
actions, proposed a decree, to summon all the Greeks in what part soever, 
whether of Europe or Asia, every city, little as well as great, to send their 
deputies to Athens to a general assembly, or convention, there to consult 
and advise concerning the Greek temples which the barbarians had burnt 
down, and the sacrifices which were due from them upon vows they had 
made to their gods for the safety of Greece when they fought against the 
barbarians, and also concerning the navigation of the sea, that they might 
henceforward pass to and fro and trade securely and be at peace among 
themselves* 

Upon this errand there were twenty men, of such as were above fifty 
years of age, sent by commission, five to summon the lonians and Dorians 
in Asia, and the islanders as far as Lesbos and Rhodes, five to visit all 
the places in the Hellespont and Thrace, up to Byzantium, and other five 
besides these to go to Boeotia and Phocis and Peloponnesus, and from 
hence to pass through the Locrians over to the neighbouring continent 
as far as Acarnama and Ambracia, and the rest to take their course 
through Eubma to the CEtaeans and the Malian Gulf, and to the Achseans 
of Phthiotis and the Thessalians, all of them to treat with the people as 
they passed, and persuade them to come and take their part in the de^ 
bates for settling the peace and jointly regulating the affairs of Greece. 

Nothing was effected, nor did the cities meet by their deputies, as was 
desired, Qie Lacedsemonians, as it is said, crossing the design under- 
hand, and the attempt being disappointed and bafSed first in Peloponnesus, 
I thought fit, however, to introduce the mention of it, to show the spirit 
of the man and the greatness of his thoughts 

In his military conduct, he gained a great reputation for wanness; he 
would not by his good-will engage m any fight which had much uncer- 
tainty or hazard, he did not envy the glory of generals whose rash ad- 
ventures fortune favoured with brilliant success, however they were 
admired by others, nor did he think them worthy his imitation, but always 
used to say to his citizens that, so far as lay in his power, they should 
continue immortal, and live for ever. Seeing Tolmides, the son of Tolmaeus, 
upon the confidence of his former successes, and flushed with the honour 
his military actions had procured him, making preparations to attack the 
Boeotians in their own country when there was no likely opportunity, and 
that he had prevailed with the bravest and most enterprising of the youth 
to enlist themselves as volunteers in the service, who besides his other 
force made up a thousand, he endeavoured to withhold him and to advise 
him from it m the pubhc assembly, tellmg him in a memorable sasnng 
of his, which still goes about, that, if he would not take Pericles’s advice, 



198 PlvUTARCH^S LIVES 

yet he would not do amiss to wait and be ruled by time, the wisest 
counsellor of all This saying, at that time, was but shghtly commended, 
but within a few days after, when news was brought that Tolmides him- 
self had been defeated and slam m battle near Coronea, and that many 
brave citizens had fallen with him, it gained him great repute as well as 
good-will among the people, for wisdom and for love of his countrymen. 

But of all his expeditions, that to the Chersonese gave most satisfaction 
and pleasure, having proved the safety of the Greeks who inhabited there. 
For not only by carrymg along with him a thousand fresh citizens of 
Athens he gave new strength and vigour to the cities, but also by beltmg 
the neck of land, which joins the penmsula to the continent, with bul- 
warks and forts from sea to sea, he put a stop to the mroads of the 
Thracians, who lay all about the Chersonese, and closed the door against 
a continual and grievous war, with which that country had been long 
harassed, lymg exposed to the encroachments and influx of barbarous 
neighbours, and groanmg under the evils of a predatory population both 
upon and within its borders 

Nor was he less admired and talked of abroad for his sailing around the 
Peloponnesus, havmg set out from Pegse, or The Fountams, the port of 
Megara, with a hundred galleys For he not only laid waste the sea-coast, 
as Tolmides had done before, but also, advanang far up into the main- 
land with the soldiers he had on board, by the terror of his appearance 
drove many withm their walls, and at Nemea, with mam force, routed 
and raised a trophy over the Sicyomans, who stood them ground and j'oined 
battle with him And having taken on board a supply of solders mto the 
galleys out of Achaia, then m league with Athens, he crossed with the 
fleet to the opposite contment, and, sailing along by the mouth of the 
river Achelous, overran Acamania and shut up the (FnigHg* withm their 
aty walls, and having ravaged and wasted their country, weighed anc ho r 
for home with the double advantage of havmg shown himself formidable 
to his enemies, and at the same time safe and energetic to his fellow- 
utizens, for there was not so much as any chance miscarriage that hai)- 
pened, the whole voyage through, to those who were under his charge. 

Entermg also the Euxine Sea with a large and finely equipped fleet, he 
obtamed for the Greek aties any new arrangements they wanted, and 
entered mto friendly relations with them; and to the barbarous nations, 
and kmgs and chiefs round about them, displayed the greatness of the 
power of the Athenians, their perfect abihty and confidence to sail where- 
ever toey had a mmd, and to brmg the whole sea under their control He left 
me Smopians thirteen ships of war, with soldiers under the command of 
Lamachus, to assist them against Timesileus the tjnrant, and when he and 
hB accomphces had been thrown out, obtained a decree that six hundred 
of the Athemam that were willmg should sail to Smope and plant them- 
sdV£s ttere with the Smopians, sharmg among them the houses and land 
which fte tyrant ^d his party had previously h el d. 

But in other things he did not comply with the giddy impulses of the 
atizens, nor qmt his own resolutions to follow them fanaes, when, carried 



PERICLES 199 

away with the thought of their strength and great success, they were eager 
to interfere again in Egypt, and to disturb the King of Persia’s maritime 
dominions Nay, there were a good many who were, even then, possessed 
with that unblest and inauspicious passion for Sicily, which afterward the 
orators of Alcibiades’s party blew up mto a flame. There were some also 
who dreamt of Tuscany and Carthage, and not without plausible reason 
in their present large dominion and prosperous course of their affairs. 

But Pericles curbed this passion for foreign conquest, and unsparmgly 
pruned and cut down their ever busy fancies for a multitude of under- 
takings, and directed their power for the most part to securmg and con- 
solidating what they had already got, supposmg it would be quite enough 
for them to do, if they could keep the Lacedaemonians in checi., to whom 
he entertained all along a sense of opposition, which, as upon many other 
occasions, so he particularly showed by what he did m the time of the 
holy war. The Lacedaemonians, having gone with an army to Delphi, re- 
stored Apollo’s temple, which the Phocians had got into their possession, 
to the Delphians, immediately after their departure, Pericles, with an- 
other army, came and restored the Phoaans. And the Lacedaemonians, 
having engraven the record of their privilege of consulting the oracle be- 
fore others, which the Delphians gave them, upon the forehead of the 
brazen wolf which stands there, he, also, havmg received from the Pho« 
Clans the like privilege for the Athenians, had it cut upon the same wolf 
of brass on his right side 

That he did well and wisely in thus restrammg the exertions of the 
Athenians within the compass of Greece, the events themselves that hap- 
pened afterward bore sufficient witness For, m the first place, the 
Euboeans revolted, against whom he passed over with forces; and then, 
immediately after, news came that the Megarians were turned their 
enemies, and a hostile army was upon the borders of Attica, under the 
conduct of Plistoanax, King of the Lacedjemonians Wherefore Pericles 
came with his army back again in all baste out of Euboea to meet the war 
which threatened at home, and did not venture to engage a numerous and 
brave army eager for battle, but perceiving that Plistoanax was a very 
young man, and governed himself mostly by the counsel and advice of 
Cleandndes, whom the ephors had sent with him, by reason of his youth, 
to be a kind of guardian and assistant to him, he privately made trial of 
this man’s integrity, and, in a short time, havmg corrupted him with 
money, prevailed with him to withdraw the Peloponnesians out of Attica. 
When the army had retired and dispersed into their several states, the 
Lacedaemonians in anger fined their king in so large a sum of money, that, 
unable to pay it, he quitted Lacedaemon, while Cleandndes fled, and had 
sentence of death passed upon him m his absence This was the father 
of Gylippus, who overpowered the Athenians m Sicily And it seems that 
this covetousness was an hereditary disease transmitted from father to 
son, for Gylippus also afterwards was caught in foul practices, and ex- 
pelled from Sparta for it. But this we have told at large m the account 
of Lysander. 



200 PLUTARCH'S LIVES 

Wheii Pei ides, in giving up his accounts of this expedition, stated a dis- 
bursement of ten talents, as laid out upon fit occasion, the people, without 
any question, nor troubling themselves to investigate the mystery, freely 
allowed of it. And some historians, in which number is Theophrastus the 
philosopher, have given it as a truth that Pericles every year used to send 
privately the sum of ten talents to Sparta, with which he complimented 
those m office, to keep off the war, not to purchase peace neither, but 
time, that he might prepare at leisure, and be the better able to carry on 
war hereafter. 

Immediately after this, turnmg his forces against the revolters, and 
passing over mto the island of Euboea with fifty sail of ships and five 
thousand men in arms, he reduced their cities, and drove out the citizens 
of the Chalcidians, called Hippobotae, horse-feeders, the chief persons 
for wealth and reputation among them, and removing all the Histiseans 
out of the country, brought in a plantation of Athenians in their room, 
making them his one example of severity, because they had captured an 
Attic ship and killed all on board. 

After this, havmg made a truce between the Athenians and Lacedse- 
monians for thirty years, he ordered, by public decree, the expedition 
against the isle of Samos, on the ground, that, when they were bid to leave 
off their war with the Milesians they had not complied. And as these 
measures against the Samians are thought to have been taken to please 
Aspasia, this may be a fit point for inquiry about the woman, what art 
or charmmg faculty she had that enabled her to captivate, as she did, 
the greatest statesmen, and to give the philosophers occasion to speak 
so much about her, and that, too, not to her disparagement. That she was 
a Milesian by birth, the daughter of Axiochus, is a thing acknowledged. 
And they say it was in emulation of Thargelia, a courtesan of the old 
Ionian times, that she made her addresses to men of great power. Thargelia 
was a great beauty, extremely chamung, and at the same time sagacious; 
she had numerous suitors among the Greeks, and brought all who had to 
do with her over to the Persian mterest, and by their means, being men 
of the greatest power and station, sowed the seeds of the Median faction 
up and down in several cities, Aspasia, some say, was courted and caressed 
by Pericles upon account of her knowledge and skill in politics Socrates 
himself would sometimes go to visit her, and some of his acquaintance with 
him; and those who frequented her company would carry their "wives with 
them to listen to her. Her occupation was anything but creditable, her 
house bemg a home for young courtesans. iEschines tells us, also, that 
Lysicles, a sheep-dealer, a man of low birth and character, by keeping 
Aspasia company after Pericleses death, came to be a chief man in Athens 
And in Platons Menexenus, though we do not take the introduction as quite 
-serious, still thus much seems to be historical, that she had the repute of 
being resorted to by many of the Athenians for instruction in the art 
Df speaking Pencles^s mclination for her seems, however, to have rather 
proceeded from the passion of love. He had a wife that was near of kin 
to him, who had been married first to Hippomcus, by whom she had Callias, 



JPERICLES 201 

surnamed the Rich, and also she brought Pericles, while she lived with 
him, two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus Afterwards, when they did not 
well agree, nor like to live together, he parted with her, with her own con- 
sent, to another man, and himself took Aspasia, and loved her with 
wonderful affection, every day, both as he went out and as he came 
in from the market-place, he saluted and kissed her. 

In the comedies she goes by the nicknames of the new Omphale and 
Deianira, and again is styled Juno. Cratmus, m downright terms, calls 
her a harlot. 


“To find him a Juno the goddess of lust 
Bore that harlot past shame, 

Aspasia by name.” 

It should seem also that he had a son by her, Eupolis, in his Demi, intro 
duced Pericles askmg after his safety, and M3rronides replying — 

“My son?” “He lives a man he had been long, 

But that the harlot-mother did him wrong.” 

Aspasia, they say, became so celebrated and renowned, that Cyrus, also 
who made war agamst Artaxerxes for the Persian monarchy, gave her 
whom be loved the best of all his concubmes the name of Aspasia, who 
before that was called Milto She was a Phocasan by birth, the daughter of 
one Hermotimus, and, when Cyrus fell m battle, was carried to the king, 
and had great influence at court. These thmgs coming mto my memory as 
I am writing this story, it would be unnatural for me to omit them. 

Pericles, however, was particularly charged with havmg proposed to the 
assembly the war against the Sanuans, from favour to the Milesians, upon 
the entreaty of Aspasia. For the two states were at war for the possession 
of Priene, and the Samians, getting the better, refused to lay down their 
arms and to have the controversy betwixt them decided by arbitration 
before the Athenians. Pericles, therefore, fitting out a fleet, went and 
broke up the oligarchical government at Samos, and taking fifty of the 
principal men of the town as hostages, and as many of their children, sent 
them to the isle of Lemnos, there to be kept, tlwugh he had offers, as 
some relate, of a talent apiece for himself from each one of the hostages, 
and of many other presents froifi those who were anxious not to have a 
democracy Moreover, Pisuthnes the Persian, one of the king’s lieutenants, 
bearing some good-will to the Samians, sent him ten thousand pieces of 
gold to excuse the city Pericles, however, would receive none of all this; 
but after he had taken that course with the Samians which he thought 
fit, and set up a democracy among them, sailed back to Athens. 

But they, however, immediately revolted, Pisuthnes having privily got 
away their hostages for them, and provided them with means for the war. 
Whereupon Pericles came out with a fleet a second time agamst them, and 
found them not idle nor slmkmg away, but manfully resolved to try for 
the dominion of the sea. The issue was, that after a sharp sea-fi^t about 



202 PLUl ARCHES LIVES 

the island called Tragia, Pericles obtained a decisive victory, having 
with forty-four ships routed seventy of the enemy's, twenty of which were 
carrying soldiers 

Together with his victory and pursuit, having made himself master of 
the port, he laid siege to the Samians, and blocked them up, who yet, one 
way or another, still ventured to make sallies, and fight under the city 
walls But after that another greater fleet from Athens was arrived, and 
that the Samians were now shut up with a close leaguer on every side, 
Pericles, taking with him sixty galleys, sailed out into the mam sea, with 
the intention, as most authors give the account, to meet a squadron of 
Phoemcian ships that were commg for the Samians' relief, and to fight 
them at as great distance as could be from the island, but, as Stesim- 
brotus says, with a design of putting over to Cyprus, which does not seem 
to be probable. But, whichever of the two was his intention, it seems to 
have been a miscalculation For on his departure, Melissus, the son of 
Ithagenes, a philosopher, bemg at that time the general in Samos, despis- 
ing either the small number of the ships that were left or the inexperience 
of the commanders, prevailed with the citizens to attack the Athenians. 
And the Samians havmg won the battle, and taken several of the men 
prisoners, and disabled several of the ships, were masters of the sea, and 
brought into port all necessaries they wanted for the war, which they had 
not before. Aristotle says, too, that Pericles had been once before this 
worsted by this Melissus m a sea-fight. 

The Samians, that they might requite an affront which had before been 
put upon them, branded the Athemans, whom they took prisoners, m their 
foreheads, with the figure of an owl. For so the Athemans had marked 
them before with a Samaena, which is a sort of ship, low and flat in the 
prow, so as to look snub-nosed, but wide and large and well-spread in 
the hold, by which it both carries a large cargo and sails well. And it was 
so called, because the first of that kind was seen at Samos, having been 
built by order of Polycrates the tyrant. These brands upon the Samians' 
foreheads, they say, are the allusion m the passage of Aristophanes, where 
he says — 

‘Tor, oh, the Samians are a lettered people." 

Pericles, as soon as news was brought him of the disaster that had 
befallen his army, made all the haste he could to come in to their relief, 
and having defeated Mehssus, who bore up against him, and put the 
enemy to flight, he immediately proceeded to hem them in with a wall, 
resolving to master them and take the town, rather with some cost and 
time than with the wounds and hazards of his citizens But as it was a 
hard matter to keep back the Athenians, who were vexed at the delay, 
and were eagerly bent to fight, he divided the whole multitude into eight 
parts, and arranged by lot that that part which had the white bean should 
have leave to feast and take their ease while the other seven were fighting. 
And this is the reason, they say, that people, when at any time they have 



PERICLES 201 

been merry, and enjoyed themselves, called it white day, in allusion to 
this white bean 

Ephorus the historian tells us besides, that Pericles made use of engines 
of battery in this siege, being much taken with the curiousness of the 
invention, with the aid and presence of Artemon himself, the engineer, 
who, being lame, used to be carried about m a litter, where the works re- 
quired his attendance, and for that reason was called Penphoretus But 
Heraclides Ponticus disproves this out of Anacreon’s poems, where men- 
tion is made of this Artemon Penphoretus several ages before the Samian 
war, or any of these occurrences And he says that Artemon, being a man 
who loved his ease, and had a great aporehension of danger, for the most 
part kept close within doors, having two of his servants to hold a brazen 
shield over his head, that nothing might fall upon him from above, and 
if he were at any time forced upon necessity to go abroad, that he was 
carried about in a little hanging bed, close to the very ground, and that 
for this reason he was called Penphoretus 

In the ninth month, the Samians surrendermg themselves and deliver- 
ing up the town, Pericles pulled down their walls, and seized their ship- 
ping, and set a fine of a large sum of money upon them, part of which they 
paid down at once, and they agreed to bring m the rest by a certain time, 
and gave hostages for security. Duns the Samian makes a tragical drama 
out of these events, charging the Athenians and Pericles with a great 
deal of cruelty, which neither Thucydides, nor Ephorus, nor Aristotle have 
given any relation of, and probably with little regard to truth, how, for 
example, he brought the captains and soldiers of the galleys into the 
market-place at Miletus, and there having bound them fast to boards for 
ten days, then, when they were already all but half dead, gave order to 
have them killed by beating out their brains with clubs, and their dead 
bodies to be flung out into the open streets and fields, unburied. Duris 
however, who, even where he has no private feeling concerned, is noi 
wont to keep his narratives within the limits of truth, is the more likely 
upon this occasion to have exaggerated the calamities which befell his 
country, to create odium against the Athenians Pericles, however, after 
the reduction of Samos, returning back to Athens, took care that those 
who died in the war should be honourably buried, and made a funeral 
harangue, as the custom is, in their commendation at their graves, for 
which he gained great admiration As he came down from the stage oi? 
which he spoke, the rest of the women came and complimented him, tak- 
ing him by the hand, and crowning him with garlands and ribbons, like a 
victorious athlete in the games, but Elpinice, coming near to him, said, 
‘^These are brave deeds, Pericles, that you have done, and such as de- 
serve our chaplets, who have lost us many a worthy citizen, not in a war 
wnth Phoenicians or Medes, like my brother Cimon, but for the over- 
throw of an allied and kindred city ” As Elpmice spoke these words, he, 
smiling quietly, as it is said, returned her answer with this verse — 

‘^Old women should not seek to be perfumed.” 



204 plutarch^slives 

Con says of him, that upon this exploit of his, conquering the Samians, he 
Indulged very high and proud thoughts of himself whereas Agamemnon 
was ten years talang a barbarous city, he had m nine months’ time van- 
quished and taken the greatest and most powerful of the lonians And 
indeed it was not without reason that he assumed this glory to himself, 
for, in real truth, there was much uncertainty and great hazard in this 
great war, if so be, as Thucydides tells us, the Samian state were within 
a very little of wresting the whole power and dominion of the sea out of 
the Athenians’ hands. 

After this was over, the Peloponnesian war beginning to break out in 
full tide, he advised the people to send help to the Corcyraeans, who were 
attacked by the Corinthians, and to secure to themselves an island pos- 
sessed of great naval resources, since the Peloponnesians were already all 
but m actual hostilities against them The people readily consenting to 
the motion, and voting an aid and succour for them, he despatched Lacedse- 
jnonms, Cimon’s son, having only ten ships with him, as it were out of a 
design to affront him, for there was a great kindness and friendship be- 
twixt Cimon’s family and the Lacedaemonians, so, in order that Lacedae- 
monius might he the more open to a charge, or suspicion at least, of 
favouring the Lacedaemonians and playing false, if he performed no con- 
siderable exploit in this service, he allowed him a small number of ships, 
and sent him out against his will, and indeed he made it somewhat his 
business to hinder Cimon’s sons from rising in the state, professing that 
by their very naipes they were not to be looked upon as native and true 
Athenians, but foreigners and strangers, one being called Lacedaemonius, 
another Thessalus, and the third Eleus, and they were all three of them, 
it was thought, born of an Arcadian woman Being, however, ill spoken 
of on account of these ten galleys, as having afforded but a small supply 
to the people that were m need, and yet given a great advantage to those 
who might complam of the act of intervention, Pericles sent out a larger 
force afterwards to Corcyxa, which arrived after the fight was over. And 
when now the Corinthians angry and indignant with the Athenians, ac* 
cused them publicly at Lacedaemon, the Megarians joined with them, com- 
plaining that they were, contrary to common right and the articles of 
peace sworn to among the Greeks, kept out and driven away from every 
market and from all ports imder the control of the Athenians. The 
iEginetans, also, professing to be ill-used and treated with violence, made 
supplications in private to the Lacedaemonians for redress, though not dar- 
ing openly to call the Athenians in question In the meantime, also, the city 
Potidaea, under the domimon of the Athenians, but a colony formerly of 
the Corinthians, had revolted, and was beset with a formal siege, and 
was a further occasion of precipitatmg the war. 

Yet notwithstanding all this, there being embassies sent to Athens, and 
Archidamus, the King of the Lacedaemonians, endeavouring to bring the 
greater part of the complaints and matters in dispute to a fair determina- 
tion, and to paafy and allay the heats of the alKes, it is very likely that 
the war would not upon any other grounds of quarr^ have fallen upon the 



PERICLES 205 

Athenians, could they have been prevailed with to repeal the ordinance 
against the Megarians, and to be reconciled to them Upon which account, 
since Pericles was the man who mainly opposed it, and stirred up th^ 
people’s passions to persist in their contention with the Megarians, he 
was regarded as the se^e cause of the war 

They say, moreover, that ambassadors went, by order, from Lacedse- 
mon to Athens about this very business, and that when Pericles wa« 
uigmg a certain law which made it illegal to take down or withdraw the 
tablet of the decree, one of the ambassadors, Polyalces by name, said, 
^Well, do not take it down then, but turn it; there is no law, I suppose, 
which forbids that,” which, though prettily said, did not move Pericles 
from his resolution There may have been, m all likelihood, somethmg of 
a secret grudge and piivate animosity which he had against the Megarians. 
Yet, upon a public and open charge against them, that they had appro- 
priated part of the sacred land on the frontier, he proposed a decree that 
a herald should be sent to them, and the same also to the Lacedaemonians, 
with an accusation of the Megarians, an order which certainly shows 
equitable and friendly proceeding enough. And after that the herald 
who was sent, by name Anthemocritus, died, and it was believed that the 
Megarians had contrived his death, then Charmus proposed a decree 
against them, that there should be an irreconcilable and implacable enmity 
thenceforward betwixt the two commonwealths, and that if any one of 
the Megarians should but set his foot in Attica, he should be put to 
death, and that the commanders, when they take the usual oath, should, 
over and above that, swear that they will twice every year make an inroad 
into the Megarian country, and that Anthemocritus should be buried near 
the Thracian Gates, which are now called the Dipylon, or Double Gate. 

On the other hand, the Megarians, utterly denying and disowning the 
murder of Anthemocritus, throw the whole matter upon Aspasia and 
Pericles, availing themselves of the famous verses in the Acharnians— 

“To Megara some of our madcaps ran. 

And stole Simsetha thence, their courtesan. 

Which exploit the Megarians to outdo, 

Came to Aspasia’s house, and took off two ” 

The true occasion of the quarrel is not so easy to find out. But of in- 
ducing the refusal to annul the decree, all alike charge Pericles Some say 
he met the request with a positive refusal, out of high spirit and a view 
of the state’s best interest, accounting that the demand made m those 
embassies was designed for a trial of their compliance, and that a con- 
cession would be taken for a confession of weakness as if they durst not 
do otherwise, while other some there are who say that it was rather out 
of arrogance and a wilful spirit of contention, to show his own strength, 
that he took occasion to slight the Lacedsemonians. The worst motive of 
all, which IS confirmed by most witnesses, is to the following effect* Phidias 
the Moulder had, as has before been said, undertaken to make the statue 



206 PLUTARCH^S LIVES 

of Minerva Now he, being admitted to friendship with Pericles, and a 
great favourite of his, had many enemies upon this account, who envied 
and maligned him, who also, to make trial in a case of his, what kind of 
judges the commons w^’ciild prove, should there be occasion to bring 
Pericles himself before them, having tampered with Menon, one who had 
been a workman with Phidias, stationed him in the market-place, with a 
petition desiring public security upon his discovery and impeachment of 
Phidias Tiie people admitting the man to tell his story, and the prosecu- 
tion proceeding in the assembly, there was nothing of theft or cheat proved 
against him, for Phidias, from the very first beginning, by the advice 
of Pericles, had so wrought and wrapt the gold that was used in the work 
about the statue, that they might take it all off, and make out the just 
weight of it, which Pericles at that time bade the accuser do. But the 
reputation of his works was what brought envy upon Phidias, especially 
that where he represents the fight of the Amazons upon the goddess’s 
shield, he had introduced a likeness of himself as a bald old man holding 
up a great stone with both hands, and had put in a very fine representation 
of Pericles fighting with an Amazon. And the position of the hand which 
holds out the spear m front of the face, was ingeniously contrived to 
conceal m some degree the likeness, which meantime showed itself on 
either side. 

Phidias then was carried away to prison, and there died of a disease, 
but, as some say, of poison, adimnistered by the enemies of Pericles, to 
raise a slander, or a suspicion at least, as though he had procured it The 
informer Menon, upon Glycon’s proposal, the people made free from 
pajnment of taxes and customs, and ordered the generals to take care that 
nobody should do him any hurt. About the same time, Aspasia was indicted 
of impiety, upon the complaint of Hermippus the comedian, who also laid 
further to her charge that she received into her house freeborn women for 
the uses of Pericles. And Diopithes proposed a decree, that public accusa- 
tions should be laid against persons who neglected religion, or taught new 
doctrines about things above, directing suspicion, by means of Anaxagoras, 
against Pericles himself The people receiving and admitting these ac- 
cusations and complaints, at length, by this means, they came to enact 
a decree, at the motion of Dracontides, that Pericles should bring in the 
accounts of the moneys he had expended, and lodge them with the Piy- 
tanes; and that the judges, carrymg their suffrage from the altar in the 
Acropolis, should examme and determine the business m the city This last 
clause Hagnon took out of the decree, and moved that the causes should 
be tried before fifteen hundred jurors, whether they should be styled 
prosecutions for robbery, or bribery, or any kmd of malversation. Aspasia, 
Pericles begged off, shedding, as iEschines says, many tears at the trial, 
and personally entreating the jurors. But fearing how it might go with 
Anaxagoras, he sent him out of the city And finding that in Phidias’s case 
he had miscarried with the people, being afraid of impeachment, he kindled 
the war, which hitherto had lingered and smothered, and blew it up into 
E flame; hoping^ by that means, to disperse and scatter these complaints 



PERICLES 207 

and charges, and to allay their jealousy, the city usually throwing herself 
upon him alone, and trusting to his sole conduct, upon the urgency of 
great affairs and public dangers, by reason of his authority and the sway 
he bore 

These are given out to have been the reasons which induced Pericles 
not to suffer the people of Athens to yield to the proposals of the Lacedae- 
monians , but their truth is uncertain 

The Lacedaemonians, for their part, feeling sure that if they could once 
remove him, they might be at what terms they pleased with the Athenians, 
sent them word that they should expel the ‘Tollution” with which Pericles 
on the mother’s side was tainted, as Thucydides tells us But the issue 
proved quite contrary to what those who sent the message expected, in- 
stead of bringing Pericles under suspicion and reproach, they raised him 
into yet greater credit and esteem with the citizens, as a man whom their 
enemies most hated and feared In the same way, also, before Archidamus, 
who was at the head of the Peloponnesians, made his invasion into Attica, 
he told the Athenians beforehand, that if Archidamus, while he laid waste 
the rest of the country, should forbear and spare his estate, either on the 
ground of friendship or right of hospitality that was betwixt them, or on 
ourpose to give his enemies an occasion of traducmg him, that then he did 
xreely bestow upon the state all his land and the buildings upon it for the 
public use The Lacedsemomans, therefore, and their allies, with a great 
army, invaded the Athenian territories, under the conduct of King Archi- 
damus, and laying waste the country, marched on as far as Acharnae, and 
there pitched their camp, presuming that the Athenians would never en- 
dure that, but would come out and fight them for their country’s and their 
honour’s sake But Pericles looked upon it as dangerous to engage in 
battle, to the risk of the city itself, against sixty thousand men-at-arms 
of Peloponnesians and Boeotians; for so many they were in number that 
made the inroad at first, and he endeavoured to appease those who were 
desirous to fight, and were grieved and discontented to see how thmgs 
went, and gave them good words, saying, that “trees, when they are lopped 
and cut, grow up agam in a short time, but men, being once lost, cannot 
easily be recovered ” He did not convene the people into an assembly, 
for tear lest they should force him to act against his j’udgment, but, like 
a skilful steersman or pilot of a ship, who, when a sudden squall comes 
on, out at sea, makes all his arrangements, sees that all is tight and fast, 
and then follows the dictates of his skill, and nunds the business of the 
ship, taking no notice of the tears and entreaties of the sea-sick and fear- 
ful passengers, so he, having shut up the city gates, and placed guards at 
all posts for security, followed his own reason and judgment, little regard- 
ing those that cried out against him and were angry at his management, 
although there were a great many of his friends that urged him with re- 
quests, and many of his enemies threatened and accused him for doing as 
he did, and many made songs and lampoons upon him, which were sung 
about the town to his disgrace, reproaching him with the cowardly ex- 



208 PLUTARCH’S LIVES 

erase of his ofSce of general, and the tame abandonment of everything to 

the enemy^s hands 

Cleon, also, already was among his assailants, making use of the feeling 
against him as a step to the leadership of the people, as appears in the 
anapasstic verses of Hermippus — 

“Satyr-kmg, instead of swords, 

Will you always handle words? 

Very brave mdeed we find them, 

But a Teles lurks behind them 

^Tet to gnash your teeth you’re seen, 

When the little dagger keen, 

Whetted every day anew, 

Of sharp Cleon touches you ” 

jt^ericles, however, was not at all moved by any attacks, but took all 
patiently, and submitted in silence to the disgrace they threw upon him 
and the ill-will they bore him; and, sending out a fleet of a hundred galleys 
to Peloponnesus, he did not go along with it in person, but stayed behind, 
that he might watch at home and keep the city under his own control, till 
the Peloponnesians broke up their camp and were gone Yet to soothe the 
common people, jaded and distressed with, the war, he relieved them with 
distributions of pubhc moneys, and ordained new divisions of subject land 
For having turned out all the people of .Egma, he parted the island among 
the Athenians according to lot. Some comfort, also, and ease in their 
miseries, they might receive from what their enemies endured For the 
fleet, sailmg round the PeloponneSe, ravaged a great deal of the country, 
and pillaged and plundered the towns and smaller cities, and by land he 
himself entered with an army the Megarian country, and made havoc 
of it all Whence it is clear that the Peloponnesians, though they did the 
Athenians much mischief by land, yet suffering as much themselves fiom 
them by sea, would not have protracted the war to such a length, but would 
quickly have given it over, as Pericles at first foretold they would, had 
not some divine power crossed human purposes 

In the first place, the pestilential disease, or plague, seized upon the 
city, and ate up all the flower and prime of their youth and strength 
Upon occasion of which, the people, distempered and aSlicted in their 
souls, as well as in their bodies, were utterly enraged like madmen against 
Pericles, and, like patients growm delirious, sought to lay violent hands on 
their physician, or, as it were, their father They had been possessed, by 
his enemies, with the behef that the occasion of the plague was the crowd- 
ing of the country people together into the town, forced as they were now, 
in the heat of the summer-weather, to dwell many of them together even as 
they could, m small tenements and stifling hovels, and to be tied to a lazy 
course of life within doors, whereas before they lived in a pure, open, and 
free air The cause and author of all this, said they, is he who on account 
of the war has poured a multitude of people m upon us within the walls, 



Pericles 209 

and uses all these men that he has here upon no employ or service, but 
keeps them pent up like cattle, to be overrun with infection from one an-* 
other, affording them neither shift of quarters nor any refreshment 

With the design to remedy these evils, and do the enemy some incon- 
venience, Pericles got a hundred and fifty galleys ready, and having em- 
barked many tried soldiers, both foot and horse, was about to sail out, 
giving great hope to his citizens, and no less alarm to his enemies, upon 
the sight of so great a force And now the vessels havmg their complement 
of men, and Pericles being gone aboard his own galley, it happened that 
the sun was eclipsed, and it grew dark on a sudden, to the affright of all, 
for this was looked upon as extremely ominous Pericles, therefore, per- 
ceiving the steersman seized with fear and at a loss what to do, took his 
cloak and held it up before the man’s face, and screenmg him with it so that 
he could not see, asked him whether he imagined there was any great hurt, 
or the sign of any great hurt in this, and he answering No, ^Why,” said 
he, ^^and what does that differ from this, only that what has caused that 
darkness there, is something greater than a cloak?” This is a story which 
philosophers tell their scholars Pericles, however, after putting out to sea^ 
seems not to have done any other exploit befitting such preparations, and 
when he had laid siege to the holy city Epidaurus, which gave him some 
hope of surrender, miscarried in his design by reason of the sickness. For 
it not only seized upon the Athenians, but upon all others, too, that held 
any sort of communication with the army Finding after this the Athenians 
ill-affected and higlily displeased with him, he tried and endeavoured 
what he could to appease and re-encourage them But he could not pacify 
or allay their anger, nor persuade or prevail with them any way, till they 
freely passed their votes upon him, resumed their power, took away his 
command from him, and fined him in a sum of money, which by their 
account that say least, was fifteen talents, while they who reckon most, 
name fifty The name prefixed to the accusation was Cleon, as Idomeneus 
^ells us; Simmias, according to Theophrastus; and Heraclides Ponticus 
gives ’t as Lacratidas, 

After this, pubhc troubles were soon to leave him unmolested, the 
people, so to say, discharged their passion m their stroke, and lost their 
stings in the wound But his domestic concerns were in an unhappy con- 
dition, many of his friends and acquaintance having died in the plague 
time, and those of his family having long smce been in disorder and in a 
kind of mutiny against him. For the eldest of his lawfully begotten sons, 
Xanthippus by name, being naturally prodigal, and marrying a young 
and expensive wife, the daughter of Tisander, son of Epilycus, was highly 
ofiended at his father’s economy in makmg him but a scanty allowance, 
by little and little at a time. He sent, therefore, to a friend one day ane 
borrowed some money of him in his father Pericles’s name, pretending li 
^as by his order The man coming afterward to demand the debt, Pericles 
was so far from yielding to pay it, that he entered an action against him 
Upon which the young man, Xanthippus, thought himself so ill-used and 
disobliged that he openly reviled his father, tdlmg first, by way of ndi-* 



210 PLUTARCH LIVES 

cule, stories about bis conversations at home, and the discouises he had 
with the sophists and scholars that came to his house As, for instance, 
how one who was a practiser of the five games of skill, having with a dart 
or javelin unawares against his will struck and killed Epitimus the Phar- 
salian, his father spent a whole day with Protagoras in a serious dispute, 
whether the javelin, or the man that threw it, or the masters of the games 
who appointed these sports, were, according to the strictest and best 
reason, to be accounted the cause of this mischance Besides this, Stesim- 
brotus tells us that it was Xanthippus who spread abroad among the people 
the mfamous story concerning his own wife, and in general that this 
difference of the young man’s with his father, and the breach betwixt them, 
continued never to be healed or made up till his death For Xanthippus 
died in the plague time of the sickness At which time Pericles also lost 
his sister, and the greatest part of his relations and friends, and those who 
had been most useful and serviceable to him in managing the affairs of 
state However, he did not shrink or give m upon these occasions, nor 
betray or lower his high spirit and the greatness of his mind under all his 
misfortunes , he was not even so much as seen to weep or to mourn, or 
even attend the burial of any of his friends or relations, till at last he lost 
his only remammg legitimate son Subdued by this blow, and yet striving 
still, as far as he could, to maintain his principle, and to preserve and keep 
up the greatness of his soul, when he came, however, to perform the 
ceremony of putting a garland of flowers upon the head of the corpse, he 
was vanquished by his passion at the sight, so that he burst into exclama- 
mations, and shed copious tears, having never done any such thing m 
his life before 

The city having made trial of other generals for the conduct of war, 
and orators for business of state, when liey found there was no one who 
was of weight enough for such a charge, or of authority sufficient to be 
trusted with so great a command, regretted the loss of him, and invited 
him agam to address and advise them, and to reassume the office of general 
He, however, lay at home in dejection and mourning, but was persuaded 
by Alcibiades and others of his friends to come abroad and show himself 
to the people; who havmg, upon his appearance, made their acknowledg- 
ments, and apologised for their untowardly treatment of him, he under- 
took the public affairs once more, and, being chosen general,, requested 
that the statute concernmg base-born children, which he himself had 
formerly caused to be made, might be suspended , that so the name and race 
of his family might not, for absolute want of a lawful heir to succeed, be 
wholly lost and extinguished The case of the statute was thus Pericles, 
when long ago at the height of his power in the state, having then, as has 
been said, diildren lawfully begotten, proposed a law that those only 
should be reputed true citizens of Athens who were born of such parents as 
were both Athenians. After this, the King of Egypt havmg sent to the 
people, by way of present, forty thousand bushels of wheat, which were 
to be shared out among the citizens, a great many actions and suits about 
legitimacy occurred, by virtue of that edict, cases which, till that time, 



PERICLES 211 

had not been known nor taken notice of, and several persons suffered by 
false accusations There were little less than five thousand who were con- 
victed and sold for slaves, those who, enduring the test, remained in the 
government and passed muster for true Athenians were found upon the 
poll to be fourteen thousand and forty persons in number 

It looked strange, that a law, which had been carried so far against sc 
many people, should be cancelled again by the same man that made it, 
yet the present calamity and distress which Pericles laboured under m 
his family broke through all objections, and prevailed with the Athenians 
to pity him, as one whose losses and misfortunes had sufficiently punished 
his former arrogance and haughtiness. His sufferings deserved, they 
thought, their pity, and even indignation, and his request was such as be- 
came a man to ask and men to grant, they gave him permission to enrol 
his son in the register of his fraternity, givmg him his own name. This son 
afterward, after having defeated the Peloponnesians at Argmusae, was 
with his fellow-generals, put to death by the people 

About the time when his son was enrolled, it should seem the plague 
seized Pericles, not with sharp and violent fits, as it did others that had 
it, but with a dull and lingering distemper, attended with various changes 
and alterations, leisurely, by little and little, wasting the strength of his 
body, and undermining the noble faculties of his soul So that Theo- 
phrastus, in his Morals, when discussing whether men’s characters change 
with their circumstances, and their moral habits, disturbed by the ailmgs 
of their bodies, start aside from the rules of virtue, has left it upon record, 
that Pericles, when he was sick, showed one of his friends that came to 
visit him an amulet or charm that the women had hung about his neck; 
as much as to say, that he was very sick indeed when he would admit of 
such a foolery as that was. 

When he was now near his end, the best of the citizens and those of 
his friends who were left alive, sitting about him, were speaking of the 
greatness of his merit, and his power, and reckoning up his famous actions 
and the number of his victories, for there were no less than nine trophieSj 
which, as their chief commander and conqueror of their enemies, he had 
set up for the honour of the city. They talked thus together among them- 
selves, as though he were unable to understand or mmd what they saii 
but had now lost his consciousness. He had listened, however, all the while, 
and attended to all, and, speaking out among them, said that he wondered 
they should commend and take notice of things which were as much 
owing to fortune as to anything else, and had happened to many other 
commanders, and, at the same time, should not speak or make mention 
of that which was the most excellent and greatest thing of all. ^*For,” 
said he, ^^no Athenian, through my means, ever wore mourning.” 

He was indeed a character deserving our high admiration not only for 
his equitable and mild temper, which all along in the many affairs of his 
life, and the great animosities which he incurred, he constantly maintained , 
but also for the high spirit and feehng which made him regard it the 
noblest of all his honours that, m the exercise of such immense power, he

never liEd gratified his envy or his passion, nor ever had treated any 
enemy as irreconcilably opposed to him And to me it appears tiiat this 
one thing gives that otherwise childish and arrogant title a fitting and 
becoming significance, so dispassionate a temper, a life so pure and un- 
blemished, m the height of power and place, might well be called Olympian, 
in accordance with our conceptions of the divine beings, to whom, as the 
natural authors of all good and of nothing evil, we ascribe the rule and 
government of the world Not as the poets represent, who, while con- 
foundmg us with their ignorant fancies, are themselves confuted by their 
own poems and fictions, and call the place, indeed, where they say the 
gods make their abode, a secure and quiet seat, free from all hazards and 
commotions, untroubled with winds or with clouds, and equally through 
all time illummed with a soft serenity and a pure light as though such 
were a home most agreeable for a blessed and immortal nature, and yet, 
in the meanwhile, affirm that the gods themselves are full of trouble and 
enmity and anger and other passions, which no way become or belong to 
even men that have any understanding But this will, perhaps, seem a 
subject fitter for some other consideration, and that ought to be treated 
of m some other place 

The course of public affairs after his death produced a quick and speedy 
sense of the loss of Pericles. Those who, while he lived, resented his great 
authority, as that which eclipsed themselves, presently after his qui^-tmg 
the stage, makmg trial of other orators and demagogues, readily acknowl- 
edged that there never had been m nature such a disposition as his was, 
more moderate and reasonable in the height of that state he took upon 
him, or more grave and impressive in the mildness which he used. And 
that invidious arbitrary power, to which formerly they gave the name of 
monarchy and tyranny, did then appear to have been the chief bulwark 
of public safety, so great a corruption and such a flood of mischief and 
vice followed which he, by keeping weak and low, had withheld from 
notice, and had prevented from attainmg incurable height through a licen- 
tious impunity.
