urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012.fuDryden:7#Pericles, while yet but a young man,
stood in considerable apprehension of the people, as he was thought in face and
figure to be very like the tyrant Pisistratus, and those of great age remarked
upon the sweetness of voice, and his volubility and rapidity in speaking, and
were struck with amazement at the resemblance Reflecting, too, that he had a
considerable estate, and was descended of a noble family, and had friends of
great influence, he was fearful all this might bring him to be banished as
a dangerous person, and for this reason meddled not at all with state
affairs, but in military service showed himself of a brave and intrepid
nature. But when Aristides was now dead, and Themistocles driven out,
and Cimon was for the most part kept abroad by the expeditions he made
in parts out of Greece, Pericles, seeing things in this posture, now advanced
and took his side, not with the rich and few, but with the many
and poor, contrary to his natural bent, which was far from democratical,
but, most likely fearing he might fall under suspicion of aiming at arbitrary
power, and seeing Cimon on the side of the aristocracy, and much
beloved by the better and more distinguished people, he joined the party
of the people, with a view at once both to secure himself and procure
means against Cimon He immediately entered, also, on quite a new course of life
and management of his time for he was never seen to walk in any street but that
which led to the market-place and council-hall, and he avoided invitations of
friends to supper, and all friendly visiting and intercourse whatever, in all
the time he had to do with the public, which was not a little, he was never
known to have gone to any of his friends to a supper, except that once
when his near kinsman Euryptolemus married, he remained present till the
ceremony of the drink-offering, and then immediately rose from table and
went his way For these friendly meetings are very quick to defeat any
assumed superiority, and in intimate familiarity an exterior of gravity is
hard to maintain Real excellence, indeed, is most recognized when most
openly looked into, and in really good men, nothing which meets the
eves of external observers so truly deserves their admiration, as their
daily common life does that of their nearer friends. Pericles, however,
to avoid any feeling of commonness, or any satiety on the part of the
people, presented himself at intervals only, not speaking to every business,
nor at all times coming into the assembly, but, as Critolaus says, reserving
himself, like the Salammian galley, for great occasions, while matters of
lesser importance were despatched by friends or other speakers under his
direction and of this number we are told Ephialtes made one, who broke
the power of the council of Areopagus, giving the people, according to
Platoâ€™s expression, so copious and so strong a draught of liberty, that growing
wild and unruly, like an unmanageable horse, it, as the comic poets say
