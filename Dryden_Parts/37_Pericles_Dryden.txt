He, however, lay at home in dejection and mourning, but was persuaded by Alcibiades and others of his friends to come abroad and show himself to the people; who having, upon his appearance, made their acknowledgments, and apologized for their untowardly treatment of him, he undertook the public affairs once more, and, being chosen general, requested that the statute concerning base-born children, which he himself had formerly caused to be made, might be suspended, that so the name and race of his family might not, for absolute want of a lawful heir to succeed, be wholly lost and extinguished.
