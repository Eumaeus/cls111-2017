moved by any attacks, but took all patiently, and submitted in silence to the
disgrace they threw upon him and the ill-will they bore him; and, sending out a
fleet of a hundred galleys to Peloponnesus, he did not go along with it in
person, but stayed behind, that he might watch at home and keep the city under
his own control, till the Peloponnesians broke up their camp and were gone Yet
to soothe the common people, jaded and distressed with, the war, he relieved
them with distributions of public moneys, and ordained new divisions of subject
land For having turned out all the people of Egma, he parted the island among
the Athenians according to lot. Some comfort, also, and ease in their
miseries, they might receive from what their enemies endured For the
fleet, sailing round the Peloponnese, ravaged a great deal of the country,
and pillaged and plundered the towns and smaller cities, and by land he
himself entered with an army the Megarian country, and made havoc
of it all Whence it is clear that the Peloponnesians, though they did the
Athenians much mischief by land, yet suffering as much themselves from
them by sea, would not have protracted the war to such a length, but would
quickly have given it over, as Pericles at first foretold they would, had
not some divine power crossed human purposes In the first place, the
pestilential disease, or plague, seized upon the city, and ate up all the flower
and prime of their youth and strength Upon occasion of which, the people,
distempered and sliced in their souls, as well as in their bodies, were
utterly enraged like madmen against Pericles, and, like patients growing
delirious, sought to lay violent hands on their physician, or, as it were, their
father They had been possessed, by his enemies, with the behalf that the
occasion of the plague was the crowding of the country people together into
the town, forced as they were now, in the heat of the summer-weather, to dwell
many of them together even as they could, in small tenements and stifling hovels,
and to be tied to a lazy course of life within doors, whereas before they lived
in a pure, open, and free air The cause and author of all this, said they, is
he who on account of the war has poured a multitude of people in upon us within
the walls, and uses all these men that he has here upon no employ or service, but
keeps them pent up like cattle, to be overrun with infection from one another,
affording them neither shift of quarters nor any refreshment
