remove him, they might be at what terms they pleased with the Athenians,
sent them word that they should expel the "pollution” with which Pericles
on the mother’s side was tainted, as Thucydides tells us But the issue
proved quite contrary to what those who sent the message expected, in-
stead of bringing Pericles under suspicion and reproach, they raised him
into yet greater credit and esteem with the citizens, as a man whom their
enemies most hated and feared In the same way, also, before Archidamus,
who was at the head of the Peloponnesians, made his invasion into Attica,
he told the Athenians beforehand, that if Archidamus, while he laid waste
the rest of the country, should forbear and spare his estate, either on the
ground of friendship or right of hospitality that was betwixt them, or on
purpose to give his enemies an occasion of traducing him, that then he did
freely bestow upon the state all his land and the buildings upon it for the
public use The Lacedsemomans, therefore, and their allies, with a great
army, invaded the Athenian territories, under the conduct of King Archi-
damus, and laying waste the country, marched on as far as Acharnae, and
there pitched their camp, presuming that the Athenians would never en-
dure that, but would come out and fight them for their country’s and their
honor’s sake But Pericles looked upon it as dangerous to engage in
battle, to the risk of the city itself, against sixty thousand men-at-arms
of Peloponnesians and Boeotians; for so many they were in number that
made the inroad at first, and he endeavored to appease those who were
desirous to fight, and were grieved and discontented to see how things
went, and gave them good words, saying, that “trees, when they are lopped
and cut, grow up again in a short time, but men, being once lost, cannot
easily be recovered ” He did not convene the people into an assembly,
for tear lest they should force him to act against his judgment, but, like
a skillful steersman or pilot of a ship, who, when a sudden squall comes
on, out at sea, makes all his arrangements, sees that all is tight and fast,
and then follows the dictates of his skill, and knows the business of the
ship, taking no notice of the tears and entreaties of the sea-sick and fear-
ful passengers, so he, having shut up the city gates, and placed guards at
all posts for security, followed his own reason and judgment, little regard-
ing those that cried out against him and were angry at his management,
although there were a great many of his friends that urged him with re-
quests, and many of his enemies threatened and accused him for doing as
he did, and many made songs and lampoons upon him, which were sung
about the town to his disgrace, reproaching him with the cowardly ex-

erase of his office of general, and the tame abandonment of everything to

the enemy's hands

Cleon, also, already was among his assailants, making use of the feeling
against him as a step to the leadership of the people, as appears in the
anapaestic verses of Hermippus —

“Satyr-king, instead of swords,

Will you always handle words?

Very brave indeed we find them,

But a Teles lurks behind them

Yet to gnash your teeth you’re seen,

When the little dagger keen,

Whetted every day anew,

Of sharp Cleon touches you ”
