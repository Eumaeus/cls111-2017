urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012.fuDryden:6# Nor were these the only advantages which Pericles derived from Anaxa 
goras’s acquaintance, he seems also to have become, by his instructions,
superior to that superstition with which an ignorant wonder at appearances,
for example, in the heavens, possesses the minds of people unacquainted
with their causes, eager for the supernatural, and excitable through
an inexperience which the knowledge of natural causes removes, replacing
wild and timid superstition by the good hope and assurance of an intelligent
piety.

There is a story, that once Pericles had brought to him from a country
farm of his a ram’s head with one horn, and that Lampon, the diviner,
upon seeing the horn grow strong and solid out of the midst of the fore-
head, gave it as his judgment, that, there being at that tune two potent
factions, parties, or interests in the city, the one of Thucydides and the
other of Pericles, the government would come about to that one of them
m whose ground or estate this token or indication of fate had shown itself.
But that Anaxagoras, cleaving the skull m sunder, showed to the by-
standers that the brain had not filled up its natural place, but being oblong,
like an egg, had collected from all parts of the vessel which contained it in
a point to that place from whence the root of the horn took its rise And
that, for that time, Anaxagoras was much admired for his explanation by
those that were present, and Lampon no less a little while after, when Thu-
cydides was overpowered, and the whole affairs of the state and government
came into the hands of Pericles.

And yet, m my opinion, it is no absurdity to say that they were both
in the right, both natural philosopher and divined, one justly detecting
the cause of this event, by which it was produced, the other the end for
which It was designed For it was the business of the one to find out and
give an account of what it was made, and m what manner and by what
means it grew as it did, and of the other to foretell to what end and pur-
pose it was so made, and what it might mean or portend. Those who say
that to find out the cause of a prodigy is in effect to destroy its supposed
signification as such, do not take notice, that, at the same time, together
with divine prodigies, they also do away with signs and signals of human
9 ^ and concert, as, for instance, the dashings of quoits, fire-beacons, and
the shadows of sundials, every one of which has its cause, and by that
cause and contrivance is a sign of something else But these are subjects,
perhaps, that would better befit another place
