The Lacedaemonians beginning to show themselves troubled at the growth of the Athenian power, Pericles, on the other hand, to elevate the peoples spirit yet more, and to raise them to the thought of great actions, proposed a decree, to summon all the Greeks from everywhere, whether of Europe or Asia, every city, small as well as great, to send their deputies to Athens to a general assembly, or convention, there to consult and advise concerning the Greek temples which the barbarians had burnt
down, and the sacrifices which were due from them upon vows they had made to their gods for the safety of Greece when they fought against the
barbarians, and also concerning the navigation of the sea, that they might henceforward pass to and fro and trade securely and be at peace among themselves.

Upon this errand there were twenty men, all of which were above fifty years of age, sent by commission, five to summon the Ionians and Dorians
in Asia, and the islanders as far as Lesbos and Rhodes, five to visit all the places in the Hellespont and Thrace, up to Byzantium, and five other besides these to go to Boeotia and Phocis and Peloponnesus, and from hence to pass through the Locrians over to the neighboring continent as far as Acarnania and Ambracia, and the rest to take their course through Euboea to the Oetaeans and the Malian Gulf, and to the Achaeans of Phthiotis and the Thessalians, all of them were a treat to the people as they passed, and persuaded them to come and take their part in the debates for settling the peace and jointly regulating the affairs of Greece.
