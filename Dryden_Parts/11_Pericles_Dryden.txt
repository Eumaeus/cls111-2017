seeing that Pericles was already before this grown to be the greatest and
foremost man of all the city, but nevertheless wishing there should be somebody
set up against him, to blunt and turn the edge of his power, that it not
altogether prove a monarchy, put forward Thucydides of Alopece, a discreet
person, and a near kinsman of Cimon's, to conduct the opposition against him;
who, indeed, though less skilled in warlike affairs than Cimon was, yet was
better versed in speaking and political business and keeping close guard in the
city, and, engaging with Pericles on the bema, in a short time brought
the government to an equality of parties. For he would not suffer those who
were called the honest and good (persons of worth and distinction) to be
scattered up and down and mix themselves and be lost among the
populace, as formerly, diminishing and obscuring their superiority amongst
the masses, but taking them apart by themselves and uniting them in one
body, by their combined weight he was able, as it were upon the balance,
to make a counterpoise to the other party.
For me, there was from the beginning a sort of concealed split, or
seam, as it might be in a piece of iron, marking the different popular and
aristocratical tendencies, but the open rivalry and contention of these two
opponents made the gash deep, and severed the city into the two parties
of the people and the few. And so Pericles, at that time, more than at any
other, let loose the reins to the people, and made his policy subservient
to their pleasure, contriving continually to have some great public show
or solemnity, some banquet, or some procession or other in the town to
please them, coaxing his countrymen like children with such delights and
pleasures as ware not, however, unedifying Besides that every year he sent
out threescore galleys, on board of which there were numbers of the
citizens, who were in pay eight months, learning at the same time and
practicing the art of seamanship. He sent, moreover, a thousand of them into the
Chersonese as planters, to share the land among them by lot, and five hundred
more into the isle of Naxos, and half that number to Andros, a thousand into
Thrace to dwell among the Bisaltse, and others into It^y, when the city Sybaris,
which now was called Thurii, was to be repeopled And this he did to
ease and discharge the city of an idle, and, by reason of their idleness,
a busy meddling crowd of people, and at the same time to meet the
necessities and restore the fortunes of the poor townsmen, and to intimidate,
also, and check their allies from attempting any change, by posting
such garrisons, as it were, in the midst of them.
