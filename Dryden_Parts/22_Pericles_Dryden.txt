 and brave army eager for battle, but perceiving that Plistoanax was a very young man, and governed himself mostly by the counsel and advice of Cleandrides, whom the ephors had sent with him, by reason of his youth, to be a kind of guardian and assistant to him, he privately made trial of this manâ€™s integrity, and, in a short time, having corrupted him with money, prevailed with him to withdraw the Peloponnesians out of Attica. When the army had retired and dispersed into their several states, the Lacedaemonians in anger fined their king in so large a sum of money, that, unable to pay it, he quitted Lacedaemon, while Cleandrides fled, and had sentence of death passed upon him m his absence This was the father of Gylippus, who overpowered the Athenians m Sicily And it seems that this covetousness was an hereditary disease transmitted from father to son, for Gylippus also afterwards was caught in foul practices, and expelled from Sparta for it. But this we have told at large m the account of Lysander.
