changed them from what they were before, and having taught them farthei
to counterfeit the very voice and carnage and gait of virgins so that there
could not be the least diffeience perceived, he, undiscovered by any, put
them into the number of the Athenian maids designed for Crete At his
return, he and these t\vo youths led up a solemn procession, in the same
habit that is now worn by those who carry the vine-branches Those
branches they carry in honour of Bacchus and Ariadne, for the sake of
their story before related, or rather because they happened to return in
autumn, the time of gathering the grapes. The women, whom they call
Deipnopherae, or supper-earners, are taken into these ceremonies, and
assist at the sacrifice, in remembrance and imitation of the mothers of
the young men and virgins upon whom the lot fell, for thus they ran about
bringing bread and meat to their children, and because the women then
told their sons and daughters many tales and stones, to comfort and en-
courage them under the danger they were going upon, it has still continued
a custom that at this feast old fables and tales should be told. For these
particularities we are mdebted to the history of Demon There was then
a place chosen out, and a temple erected in it to Theseus, and those
families out of whom the tribute of the youth was gathered were appointed
to pay tax to the temple for sacrifices to him. And the house of the Phy-
talidse had the overseeing of these sacrifices, Theseus doing them that
honour in recompense of their former hospitality.
Now, after the death of his father ^Egeus, forming in his mmd a great
and wonderful design, he gathered together all the inhabitants of Attica
into one town, and made them one people of one city, whereas before they
lived dispersed, and weie not easy to assemble upon any affair for the
common interest Nay, differences and even wars often occurred between
them, which he by his persuasions appeased, going from township to
towmship, and from tribe to tribe. And those of a more private and mean
condition readily embracing such good advice, to those of greater power
he promised a commonwealth without monarchy, a democracy, or people’s
government, in which he should only be continued as their commander in
war and the protector of their laws, all things else being equally distributed
among them, — ^and by this means brought a part of them over to his pro-
posal The rest, fearing his power, which was already grown very formid-
able, and knowing his courage and resolution, chose rather to be persuaded
than forced into a compliance He then dissolved all the distinct state-
houses, council halls, and magistracies, and built one common state-house
and council hall on the site of the present upper town, and gave the name of
Athens to the whole state, ordaining a common feast and sacrifice, which
he called Panathenaea, or the sacrifice of all the united Athenians. He in-
stitutedalso another sacrifice called Metoecia, oi Feast of Migration, which
is yet celebrated on the sixteenth day of Hecatombseon. Then, as he had
promised, he laid down his regal power and proceeded to order a common-
wealth, entering upon this great work not without advice from the god^v
