Though Aristotle tells us that he was thoroughly practiced all accomplishments of this kind by Pythoclides Damon, it is not unlikely, being a sophist, out of policy sheltered himself under the profession of music to conceal from people m general his skill in other things, and tinder this presence attended Perides, the young athlete of politics, so to say, as his training master in these exercises Damon’s lyre, however, did not prove altogether a successful bend; he was banished the country by ostracism for ten years, as a dangerous intermeddler and a favorer of arbitrary power, and, by this means, gave the stage occasion to play upon him. As, for instance, Plato, the comic poet, introduces a character who questions him Tell me, if you please, Since you’re the Chiron who taught Pericles ” Pericles, also, was a hearer of Zeno, the Eleatic, who treated of natural philosophy in the same manner as Parmenides did, but had also perfected himself in an art of his own for refuting and silencing opponents in argument, as Timon of Phlius describes it Also the two-edged tongue of mighty Zeno, who Say what one would, could argue it untrue ” But he that saw most of Pericles, and furnished him most especially with a weight and grandeur of sense, superior to all arts of popularity, and in general gave him his elevation and sublimity of purpose and of character, was Anaxagoras of Clazomense, whom the men of those times called by the name of Nous, that is, mind, or intelligence, whether in admiration of the great and extraordinary gift he had displayed for the science of nature, or because that he was the first of the philosophers who did not refer the first ordering of the world to fortune or chance, nor to necessity or compulsion, but to a pure, unadulterated intelligence, which m all other existing mixed and compound things acts as a preamble of discrimination, and of combination of like with like.
