sort of thought, derived hence not merely, as was natural, elevation of
purpose and dignity of language, raised far above the base and dishonest
buffooneries of mob eloquence, but, besides this, a composure of countenance,
and a serenity and calmness in all his movements, which no occurrence
whilst he was speaking could disturb, a sustained and even tone of
voice, and various other advantages of a similar kind, which produced the
greatest effect on his hearers Once, after being reviled and ill-spoken of all
day long in his own hearing by some vile and abandoned fellow in the open
market-place, where he was engaged in the despatch of some urgent affair
he continued his business in perfect silence, and in the evening returned
home composedly, the man still dogging him at the heels, and pelting him
all the way with abuse and foul language, and stepping into his house, it
being by this time dark, he ordered one of his servants to take a light, and
to go along with the man and see him safe home Ion, it is true, the dramatic
poet, says that Pericles’s manner in company was somewhat over-assuming
and pompous, and that into his high-bearing there entered a good deal of
slightingness and scorn of others, he reserves his commendation for Cimon’s
ease and pliancy and natural grace m society Ion, however, who must needs
make virtue, like a show of tragedies, include some comic scenes, we shall
not altogether rely upon; Zeno used to bid those who called Pericles’s
gravity the affectation of a charlatan, to go and affect the like themselves,
inasmuch as this mere counterfeiting might in time insensibly instill into
them a real love and knowledge of those noble qualities.
