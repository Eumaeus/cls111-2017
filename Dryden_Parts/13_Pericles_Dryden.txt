Undertakings, any one of which singly might have required, they thought, for their completion, several successions and ages of men, were every one of them accomplished in the height and prime of one man’s political service. Although they say, too, that Zeuxis once, having heard Agatharchus the painter boast of dispatching his work with speed and ease, replied, “I take a long time.” For ease and speed in doing a thing do not give the work lasting soldity or exactness of beauty; the expenditure of time allowed to a man’s pains beforehand for the production a thing is repaid by way of interest with a vital force for the preservation when once produced. For which reason Pericles’s works are especially admired, as having been made quickly, to last long For every particular piece of his work was immediately, even at that time, for its beauty and elegance, antique; and yet in its vigor and freshness looks to this day as if it were just executed There is a sort of bloom of newness upon those works of his, preserving them from the touch of time, as if they had some perennial spirit and undying vitality mingled in the composition of them Phidias had the oversight of all the works, and was surveyor-general, though upon the various portions other great masters and workmen were employed For Callicrates and Ictinus built the Parthenon, the chapel at Eleusis, where the mysteries were celebrated, was begun by Coroebus, who erected the pillars that stand upon the floor or pavement, and joined them to the architraves, and after his death Metagenes of Xypete added the frieze and the upper line of columns, Xenocles of Cholargus roofed or arched the lantern on top of the temple of Castor and Pollux; and the long wall, which Socrates says he himself heard Pericles propose to the people, was undertaken by Callicrates This work Cratmus ridicules, as long in finishing “’Tis long since Pericles, if words would do it, Talked up the wall, yet adds not one mite to it,”The Odeum, or music-room, which in its interior was full out seats and ranges of pillars, and outside had its roof made to slope and descend from one single point at the top, was constructed, we are told, m imitation of the King of Persia’s Pavilion, this likewise by Pericles’s order; which Cratinus again, in his comedy called the Thracian Women, made an occasion of raillery- “So, we see here, Jupiter Long-pate Pericles appear. Since ostracism time, he’s laid aside his head, and wears the new Odeum m its stead.” Pericles, also eager for distinction, then first obtained the decree for a contest m musical skill to be held yearly at the Panathensea, and he himself, being chosen judge, arranged the order and method in which the competitors should sing and play on the flute and on the harp. And both at that time, and at other times also, they sat m this music-room to see and hear all such trials of skill. The propylaea, or entrances to the Acropolis, were finished in five years’ time, Mnesicles being the principal architect A strange accident happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse to the work, but was aiding and cooperating to bring it to perfection One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When Pericles was in distress about this, Minerva appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion was that he set up a brass statue of Minerva, surnamed Health, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before But it was Phidias who wrought the goddess’s image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the pedestal as the workman of it, and indeed the whole work m a manner was under his charge, and he had, as we have said already, the oversight over all the artists and workmen, through Pericles’s friendship for him, and this, indeed, made him much envied, and his patron shamefully slandered with stones, as if Phidias were in the habit of receiving, for Pericles’s use, freeborn women that came to see the works The comic Writers of the town, when they had got hold of this story, made much of It, and bespattered him with all the ribaldry they could invent, charging him falsely with the wife of Menippus, one who was his friend and served as lieutenant under him m the wars , and with the birds kept by Pyrilampes, an acquaintance of Pericles, who, they pretended, used to give presents of peacocks to Pericles’s female friends And how can one wonder at any number of strange assertions from men whose whole lives were devoted to mockery, and who were ready at any time to sacrifice the reputation of their superiors to vulgar envy and spite, as to some evil genius, when even Stesimbrotus the Thracan has dared to lay to the charge of Pericles a monstrous and fabulous piece of criminality with his son’s wife? So very difficult a matter is it to trace and find out the truth of anything by history, when, on the one hand, those who afterwards write it find long periods of time intercepting their view, and, on the other hand, the contemporary records of any actions and lives, partly through envy and ill-will, partly through favor and flattery, pervert and distort truth.
