urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012.fuDryden:16#Thucydides, indeed, gives a plain statement of the greatness of his power, and the comic poets, in their spiteful manner, more than hint at it, styling his companions and friends the new Pisistratidae, and calling on him to abjure any intention of usurpation, as one whose eminence was too great to be any longer proportionable to and compatible with a democracy or popular government And Teleclides says the Athenians had surrendered up to him— "The tribute of the cities, and with them, the cities too, to do with them as he pleases, and undo, to build up, if he likes, stone walls around a town, and again, if so he likes to pull them down. Their treaties and alliances, power, empire, peace, and war, their wealth and their success forever more” Nor was all this the luck of some happy occasion, nor was it the mere bloom and grace of a policy that flourished for a season, but having for forty years together maintained the first place among statesmen such as Ephialtes and Leocrates and Myronides and Cimon and Tolmides and Thucydides were, after the defeat and banishment of Thucydides, for no less than fifteen years longer, in the exercise of one continuous unintermitted command in the office, to which he was annually re-elected, of General, he preserved his integrity unspotted, though otherwise he was not altogether idle or careless in looking after his pecuniary advantage, his paternal estate, which of right belonged to him, he so ordered that it might neither through negligence be wasted or lessened, nor yet, being so full of business as he was, cost him any great trouble or time with taking care of it, and put it into such a way of management as he thought to be the most easy for himself, and the most exact. All his yearly products and profits he sold together in a lump, and supplied his household needs afterwards by buying everything that he or his family wanted out of the market. Upon which account, his children, when they grew to age, were not well pleased with his management, and the women that lived with him were treated with little cost, and complained of his way of house keeping, where everything was ordered and set down from day to day, and reduced to the greatest exactness, since there was not there, as is usual in a great family and a plentiful estate, anything to spare, or over and above, but all that went out or came in, all disbursements and all receipts, proceeded as it were by number and measure. His manager in all this was a single servant, Evangelus by name, a man either naturally gifted or instructed by Pericles so as to excel every one in this art of domestic economy. All this, in truth, was very little in harmony with Anaxagoias’s wisdom, if, indeed, it be true that he, by a kind of divine impulse and greatness of spirit, voluntarily quitted his house, and left his land to lie fallow and to be grazed by sheep like a common. But the life of a contemplative philosopher and that of an active statesman are, I presume, not the same thing, for the one merely employs, upon great and good objects of thought, an intelligence that requires no aid of instruments nor supply of any external materials, whereas the other, who tempers and applies his virtue to human uses, may have occasion for affluence, not as a matter of necessity, but as a noble thing, which was Pericles’s case, who relieved numerous poor citizens. However, there is a story that Anaxagoras himself, while Pericles was taken up with public affairs, lay neglected, and that, now being grown old, he wrapped himself up with a resolution to die for want of food, which being by chance brought to Pericles’s ear, he was horror-struck, and instantly ran thither, and used all the arguments and entreaties he could to him lamenting not so much Anaxagoras’s condition as his own, should he lose such a counsellor as he had found him to be, and that, upon this, Anaxagoras unfolded his robe, and showing himself, made answer: "Pericles," said he, "even those who have occasion for a lamp supply it with oil"
